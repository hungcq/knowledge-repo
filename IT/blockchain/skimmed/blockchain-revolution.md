# Blockchain Revolution
Don Tapscott and Alex Tapscott 2018

## Category
IT, blockchain, economics, politics, sociology

## Structure
Skipped, not worth analyzing

## Author problems & solution
- Preface not very useful: lengthy, required reading of the first edition
- Basic skimming:
  - Provide basic knowledge of blockchain (very short)
  - Discuss principles behind blockchain design
  - Discuss economic, political & social implications behind those principles

## Presentation & style
- Lots of references
- Lots of big words. Does it reflect the complexity of the problem or just an attempt to confuse the reader?

## Conclusion
- Not worth an analytical reading. After a quick skim of some passages:
  - Full of groundless arguments, without and data to back up
  - Wishful, unrealistic examples of blockchain applications
- A test for the validity of arguments: it has been 6 years seen the publication of this book, have your life or others been transformed through blockchain technology? NOPE
