# 5. Eliminating toil
- Main types of SRE activities:
  - Toil:
    - Def: the kind of work tied to running a production service that tends to be:
      - Manual
      - Repetitive
      - Automatable
      - Interupt-driven and reactive, rather than strategy-driven and proactive
      - Devoid of enduring value
      - Scale linearly as a service growth
  - Engineering work:
    - Software engineering: involve writing or modifying code, in addition to any associated design and documentation work
    - Systems engineering: involve:
      - Configuring production systems, modifying configurations, or documenting systems
        in a way that produces lasting improvements from a one-time effort
      - Consulting on architecture, design and productionization for dev teams
      - Eg: monitor setup & updates, setup/configure load balancing, setup server configuration, tuning OS param
  - Overhead: administrative work not tied directly to running a service (eg hiring, HR paperwork, meetings, training courses)
- Process of eliminating toil:
  - Set goal of 50% time spent on engineering work
  - Calculate toil: time spent on-call as lower bound on toil
- Advs of less toil:
  - Enable the SRE org to scale up sublinearly with service size
  - Manage services more efficiently than either a pure dev team or a pure ops team
- Toil is bad when it is too much. Reasons:
  - Career stagnation
  - Low morale
  - Confusion: about responsibility of the role
  - Slow product's feature velocity
  - Set precedent for dev counterparts to shift operational tasks to SRE
  - Promote attrition: high turn-over rate for people who don't like toil
