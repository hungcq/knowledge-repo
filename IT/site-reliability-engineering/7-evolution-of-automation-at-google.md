## 7. The evolution of automation at Google
- Advs:
  - More consistent compared to human operators
  - Of a platform: centralized, extensible, reusable, sellable
  - Faster repairs when run regularly to detect & repair common faults
  - Faster action: no need for manual confirmation
- Use cases:
  - Examples:
    - User account creation
    - Cluster turnup & turndown for services
    - Software/hardware installation preparation & decommissioning
    - Rollouts of new software versions
    - Runtime config changes
    - Dependency changes
  - Focus: manage lifecycle of systems, not their data: hard to manage small change in data
  - Tradeoff: high level, complex tool vs low level, reusable tool/language
  - Automate directly within the app:
    - Adv: no glue logic
    - -> No integration issue
    - Eg: automatic DB failover, not via external script
- Transparency of internal operation is imp for understanding & troubleshooting
