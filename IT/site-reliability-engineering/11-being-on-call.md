## 10. Being on-call
- Typical activities of an on-call engineer:
  - Available to perform operations on production systems within minutes:
    - Determine response time based on desired service availability
    - Steps:
      - Receive & ack a page
      - Triage the problems & work toward its resolution
      - Involve other team members & escalating as needed
  - Handle and/or vet non-paging production events
- Practices:
  - Maintain balance:
    - In quantity: 25% time spent on-call (eg 1 week/month)
    - In quality: on-call engineer have sufficient time to deal with any incidents & follow-up activities
    (eg writing postmortems)
    - -> Limit num of incident = on-call time/time to handle
    - Compensation: types:
      - Time-off in=lieu
      - Cash
  - Make on-call engineers feel safe:
    - Rational, focused, deliberate cognitive functions mode of thinking is better
    when dealing with outages related to complex systems
    - -> Need to reduce stress
    - -> Provide on-call resources:
      - Clear escalation paths: dev team
      - Well-defined incident-management procedures: supported by web-based tool
      - Blameless postmortem culture: focus on event, build automation to avoid future error
  - Setting appropriate operational load:
    - Temporarily load an experienced SRE to an overloaded team
    - -> Need to measure symptoms of operational overload
    - Eliminate noisy/duplicating alerts
    - Work with dev team, routing alert to them if their changes have large impact
    - Operational underload -> out of touch with production systems -> confidence issue & knowledge gaps. Approaches:
      - Ensure sufficient load by on-call rotation
      - Provide training activities
### Additional info
- Can have secondary on-call: responsibility depend on team arrangement
- Multi-site team:
  - Advs:
    - Avoid night shifts by rotations
    - Reduce number of on-call engineers
  - Disadv: communication & coordination overhead
