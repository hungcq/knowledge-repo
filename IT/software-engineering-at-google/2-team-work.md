# II - Culture
## 2. How to work well on teams
- Tendency to hide WIP so people won't judge
- -> Part of bigger problem: want to be seen as genius
- -> Only a myth: great works are result of collaboration
- Why shouldn't hide:
  - Early detection of mistake -> reduced cost
  - Have backup -> reduced risk
  - Advice to problems, shared knowledge -> efficiency
- SE is a team endeavor
- 3 pillars of social interaction:
  - Humility
  - Respect
  - Trust
- -> Good rela will help get the work done
- Creative nature of SE requires risk being taken & mistake being learned
- -> How to learn from mistakes: document failures by performing root-cause analysis & writing a postmortem describing:
  - Summary of the event
  - Timeline
  - Primary cause
  - Impact & damage
  - Immediate actions to fix
  - Preventive actions
  - Lessons learned
