## 6. Leading at scale
- Problem: how to lead a set of related teams
- Decision-making process when solving ambiguous, high-level problems:
  - Identify the blinder: bigger picture view, new perspective
  - -> Ask questions about previous assumptions
  - Identify the key tradeoffs
  - Decide, then iterate/re-evaluate the tradeoffs & re-decide
- Build self-driving team
  - Aim: you are no longer single point of failure
  - How:
    - Divide the problem space, delegate to team leaders
    - Spend most time observing & listening, then make critical judgement/decision
- Success generates more responsibilities & work over time
- -> Scale your own time & attention & protect your energy:
  - Divide imp & urgent tasks: focus on imp tasks:
    - Delegate
    - Schedule dedicated time
    - Use a tracking system
  - Divide & drop 80% unimp work: will be handled by others or will make itself noticeable
  - Take break & occasion to recharge
