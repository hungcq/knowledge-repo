# 10. *Documentation*
## Overview
- SEs write most of the doc themselves
- -> Need proper processes, tools & incentives
- Advs:
  - Understandable code & APIs
  - Clearly stated design goals & team objectives -> project team are more focused
  - Clear steps for manual processes
  - Less effort to onboard new members to a team/code base
  - Long term benefit to all future readers
- Reasons why doc is not popular:
  - No immediate benefit to writers
  - Engineers' attitude:
    - View writing as a separate skill than that of programming
    - Don't feel like they are capable writers
  - Limited tools & integration into dev workflow
  - Doc is view as extra burden to be maintained
## Best practices
- Treat as code:
  - With owner/maintainer
  - With internal policies/standard rules to optimized for readers
  - Version controlled
  - Review changes
  - Track issues
  - Evaluated periodically
  - With tools to measure accuracy, freshness...
- Write for audience:
  - Identify the audience formally/informally before writing
  - Criteria to categorize audience:
    - Experience level (eg expert or junior)
    - Domain knowledge (eg team member or outsider)
    - Purpose (eg quick reference or checking implementation details)
    - How a user encounters the doc:
      - Seekers knowing what they want: focus on consistency in style to support efficient search
      - Stumblers not knowing exactly what they want: provide overview/intro & intended audience
    - Customer vs provider (implementor): create separate doc for each type
  - -> Write the doc at their level
  - How to approach a broad audience: keep the doc short: might require maintaining a larger, detailed one
- Know the dif types, not mix types
## Doc types
- Reference doc (most common type):
  - Usually generated from code comments
  - 2 types by purpose:
    - API comments
    - Implementation comments
  - 3 types by place:
    - File comments:
      - Should be used for all files
      - Content:
        - Main use cases
        - Intended audience
    - Class comments: content:
      - Purpose of the class
      - Important methods
    - Function/public method comments:
      - Use indicative verb
      - Content:
        - What the function does
        - What is returned
- Design doc:
  - 

## Additional info
- Canonical doc to avoid conflicts of docs with dif owners
