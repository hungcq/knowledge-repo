## 24. Continuous delivery
- Advs of early & frequent release:
  - Enable teams to see the impact of their work quickly & adapt faster to a shifting market
  - Reduce the time between code complete & user feedback to minimize the cost of WIP
- Goal: reduce cost, increase discipline & make the risks of release more incremental
- -> Need to resist the obvious operational fixes (S approach):
  - Reverting to a traditional planning model that leaves little room for learning or iteration
  - Add more governance & oversight to the development process
  - Implement risk reviews or rewarding low-risk & often low-value features
- -> Need to migrate to a microservice architecture
- Process:
  - Flag-guard all changes. Risks:
    - Code can still be scraped and analyzed if not well-obfuscated
    - Not all features can be hidden behind flags without adding a lot of complexity
  - Release frequently & leave changes that can't meet the deadline behind
  - Use dynamic, configurable deployments to pack only the needed features
  - Use A/B experiments to evaluate the tradeoffs between a feature's cost & its value to users & business
  - Release qualification model to handle the diversity of clients (eg Android):
    - Use representative testing when comprehensive testing is not feasible
    - Gradual release
    - Automated A/B release: no human needed to monitor & make decision
