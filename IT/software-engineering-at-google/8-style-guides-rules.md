# III - Processes
## 8. Style guides and rules
- Rule: not strictly prescriptive: might need judgement
- Guidance (dif vs rule): best practice, not strictly enforced
- Goals:
  - Sustainability
  - Productivity: let dev focus on dev, not style
- Rule creation:
  - Focus on goal
  - Principles:
    - Brief: imp point only -> easy to remember & apply
    - Optimized for readers, not writers
    - Consistent:
      - Easy to understand, esp for people who switch projects
      - Take adv of tools to scale
      - Avoid having to decide everytime
    - -> Think long-term, adhere to widely accepted standard
    - Avoid error-prone/complex features: easy to understand & avoid bugs
    - Concede to optimization, practicalities & interoperability -> adjustment
  - Record decisions leading to the rule
  - -> Easy to reevaluate when assessing change proposal
- Changing rule process: identify existing problems -> solutions
- Enforcing rules:
  - Socially: teaching & training
  - Technically:
    - Tooling: error checker, code formatter
    - Advs:
      - Correctness
      - Scalability
    - Disadv: can't apply to rules requiring judgement
