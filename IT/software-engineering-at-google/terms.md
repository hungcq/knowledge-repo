# Testing
- Test size: resources needed to run the test
- Test scope: how much code is being validated (not executed) by a given test
- Hermetic: contain all the info necessary to set up, execute & tear down
- Code coverage: % feature code executed by tests
- Exploratory testing:
  - A form of manual testing
  - Interact with a product via a public API, try new paths/user scenarios in the system
  - Looking for:
    - Behavior deviating from expected/intuitive behavior
    - Security vulnerability
- Test infrastructure: code shared across multiple test suites
- Test double: an object or function that can stand in for a real implementation in a test
- Fidelity: how closely the behavior of a test double resembles the behavior of the real implementation
- Mocking framework: a software library that makes it easier to create test doubles within tests by allowing replacing an object with a mock
- -> Don't need to define a test double class -> reduce boilerplate 
- Mock: a test double whose behavior is specified inline in a test
- Fake: a lightweight implementation of an API that behaves similar to the real implementation but isn't suitable for production (eg in-memory DB)
- Stubbing: the process of giving behavior to a function that otherwise has no behavior by specifying what values to return
- Interaction testing (mocking): a way to validate how & whether a function is called without actually calling the implementation of the function
