## 7. Measuring engineering productivity
- Goal:
  - Improve SE productivity -> can scale
  - Measure efficiently
- Hard to measure
- -> Create productivity specialist team: multi-discipline -> understand both tech & human aspects
- How to decide whether it is worth measuring:
  the data help stakeholders make a decision, not to prove/disprove a hypothesis
- Goals/signals/metrics framework to guide metric creation:
  - Goal
  - Signal:
    - How you might know that you have achieved the end result
    - Might not be measurable
  - Metric:
    - Proxy to a signal
    - Measurable
- -> Benefits:
  - Avoid bias
  - Decide & ack in advance what is measurable
  - Maintain traceability (ie what this metric is for)
- Insights from qualitative metrics:
  - Contexts/narrative
  - Next steps to improve a process
  - Validation for quantitative metrics
- Final step:
  - Take action: improve tools & processes
  - Track result
