# 13. *Test doubles*
- Impact of test doubles on software development:
  - Codebase needs to be designed to be testable (eg use dep injection)
  - -> Can swap out real implementation with test doubles
  - Double should be used carefully to avoid brittle, complex tests
  - Behavior of test double should closely resemble behavior of real implementation
  - -> No perfect fidelity -> need to supplement unit tests with larger scope tests that exercise real implementation
- Techniques for using test doubles:
  - *Faking*:
    - Ideal technique
    - Challenge: ensure & maintain its behavior to stay similar to the real implementation
  - *Stubbing* & *interaction testing*:
    - Usually done through mocking frameworks to reduce boilerplate
    - Overuse can lead to problems
