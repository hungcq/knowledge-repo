# Chaining Linux commands: Pipes & Substitution

## Info
- Type: Chat-GPT conversation
- [Full conversation](./resources/chaining-linux-commands.md)

## 1. **Command Chaining in Linux**
- Discussed how to chain commands in Linux, focusing on pipes (`|`) and command substitution (`$(...)` or backticks).
- Aimed at passing the output of one command as the input to another.

## 2. **Clarification on Command Behaviors**
- Clarified the behavior of `grep 'pattern' filename | wc -l` and its form using command substitution.
- Highlighted how handling of large outputs and whitespace can affect results.

## 3. **Custom Go Programs for Demonstration**
- Provided two Go program examples: `program1` and `program2`.
  - `program1`: Reads from stdin and converts text to uppercase.
  - `program2`: Generates output to be piped into `program1`.
- Discussed how to compile and use these programs.

## 4. **Modifying Program Behavior**
- Modified `program1` to exit after processing the first input line.
- Adapted `program1` to handle both streaming (via stdin) and argument-based input.

## 5. **Understanding Pipes vs. Arguments in Programs**
- Explored the differences and use cases of streaming data through pipes vs. passing data through arguments.
- Emphasized that these methods are distinct and generally not interchangeable.

## 6. **Handling Program Termination**
- Discussed various methods to terminate a program reading from stdin, including:
  - EOF signal (Ctrl + D)
  - Specific termination strings
  - Piping predetermined input
  - Using a timeout
  - Programmatically closing the input stream.

## Conclusion
- The conversation covered key concepts in Linux command line operations and Go programming, with a focus on data handling, program design, and execution methodologies.
