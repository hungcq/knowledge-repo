## 2. Interview framework
### Overview
- Purpose of SDIs: test communication & problem-solving skills:
  - Technical design skill
  - Collaboration skill
  - Ability to work under pressure
  - Skill to resolve ambiguity constructively
  - Ability to ask good question
- Red flags:
  - Over-engineering, ignore tradeoffs: costly system
  - Narrow-minded
  - Stubborn
### 4-step process
- Problem & design scope: clarify requirements & assumptions:
  - What problem is the system trying to solve?
  - Who are the users of the system?
  - What are the specific features to build?
  - Load: num users, CCU, request/s
  - Availability: tolerate single hardware/data center failure?
  - Scalability: anticipation of growth (scale in next month/year)
  - Existing services/stack to fit into or can be reused for the design
  - Organizational: large, multi team org with separate infra team or new, small org?
  - -> Microservices for productivity or simple monolith app for fast iteration & reduced operational effort
- High level design (10-15 min) & ask feedback:
  - Main components
  - Use cases: flow & components involved
  - APIs (optional)
  - DB schema (optional)
  - Rough calculations (optional): QPS & peak QPS (eg x2), storage, cache, number of servers
- -> Suggest multiple approaches if possible: DB, event sourcing, communication mechanism
- Detailed design (10-25 min):
  - Ask which aspect/component to prioritize (eg API, DB schema, flow, communication mechanism, observability)
  - Can be based on feedback from prev step
- Wrap up (3-5 min): actively discuss:
  - Bottleneck, improvement
  - Design recap
  - Error/edge cases
  - Operational issues: monitoring, deployment
  - Handling the next scale (eg x10 users)
