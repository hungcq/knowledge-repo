- What are the dif techniques to:
  - Improve service availability: load balancing, async messaging, multiple data centers
  - Improve DB availability: replication
  - Reduce load, improve performance for DB: replication, sharding, caching
  - Reduce response time: caching, CDN, local data center
  - Reduce coupling, scale independently: load balancing, async messaging
