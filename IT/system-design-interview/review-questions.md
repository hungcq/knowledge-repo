- What are the dif techniques to:
  - Improve service availability
  - Improve DB availability
  - Reduce load, improve performance for DB
  - Reduce response time
  - Reduce coupling, scale independently
- What are the limits of vertical scaling?
- How many phases are there of a typical system design interview? What should be done at each phase?
- What is CAP theorem? What does each term mean?

# Answer
- What are the dif techniques to:
  - Improve service availability: load balancing, async messaging
  - Improve DB availability: replication
  - Reduce load, improve performance for DB: replication, sharding, caching
  - Reduce response time: caching, CDN, local data center
  - Reduce coupling, scale independently: load balancing, async messaging
