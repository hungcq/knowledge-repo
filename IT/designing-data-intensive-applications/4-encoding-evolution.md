## 4. Encoding & evolution
- Difficulty when update code immediately after schema change:
  - Server: many nodes -> usually do rolling upgrade
  - Client: depend on user
- Compatibility:
  - Backward: new code can read old data
  - Forward: old code can read data written by new code
- Data representations:
  - In memory: DS & pointers
  - In file & over network: sequence of bytes 
- -> Encode/serialize data from mem to disk/network representation, then decode to mem
### 4.1. Encoding formats
- Language-specific formats:
  - Language-dependent: inflexible
  - Security: instantiate arbitrary classes
  - Versioning problem
  - Not efficient
- JSON, XML & binary variants: verbose because of text format & keeping field names
- Thrift & Protocol buffers:
  - Use field tags (int) -> lighter
  - Versioning by field tags
  - Evolution:
    - Not reuse field tags
    - Not add/remove required field
- Avro:
  - Use for encoding many similar records. Schema included at start of the encoded file.
  - Decode: match writer & reader schema by field name
  - Use schema history for evolution
  - Light-weight: no field name, field tag
- Advs of schemas:
  - Compact
  - Can be used as documentation. Track changes.
  - Can gen code from schema
### 4.2. Modes of data flow between processes
- Through DB:
  - Old code should ignore new fields, not write the whole object
  - Migrate:
    - All rows: expensive
    - Gradually when read
- Through services: REST & RPC:
  - RPC problem: treat network calls (many complications) like function calls
  - Evolution: if can't force client to update, keep multi versions of the same API
- Through async messages:
  - Advs:
    - Buffer between services -> handle failure
    - No service discovery needed
    - Allow 1 to many
    - Decouple sender - recipient
  - Distributed actor framework:
    - Base on actor model: actor (logic) handle async messages sent by other actors
    - Distributed: actors on dif nodes, mes sent across nodes 
    - -> Mes can be lost
    - Problem: language-specific encoding format, difficult evolution 
    - -> Need to replace with other format (e.g. Protocol buffers)
