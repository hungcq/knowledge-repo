# 2. Exploring the microservices world with Spring Cloud
- Spring Cloud:
  - Def: common framework containing several popular cloud-management microservice frameworks
  - -> Help operate & deploy microservices to a private/public cloud
  - Features:
    - Service registration & discovery: Spring Cloud Service Discovery: Consul, Zookeeper, Eureka
    - Reliability:
      - Spring Cloud LoadBalancer: client-side LB
      - Resilience4j: client resiliency patterns: circuit breaker, retry, bulkhead
    - API gateway: Spring Cloud Gateway
    - Messaging: Spring Cloud Stream
    - Correlation ID for logging & tracing: Spring Cloud Sleuth
    - Security: authentication & authorization: Spring Cloud Security
    - Config: Spring Cloud Config:
      - Handle env specific config data
      - Data sources:
        - Its own
        - Git
        - Key-value DB of service discovery projects (Consul, Eureka)
- Spring Cloud Config parent BOM (Bill of Materials): contain all the third-party libraries and dependencies that are
  used in the cloud project and the version numbers of the individual projects that make up that version
- -> All the subprojects have compatible versions
- -> Independent of Spring Boot -> need to check Spring Cloud website for version dependencies between Boot & Cloud
