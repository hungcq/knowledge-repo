## 2. Decomposition strategies
### Architectural view & architectural style
- Architectural view in 4+1 model: describes a particular aspect of the architecture
  - <img src="./resources/2.1.png" alt="drawing" width="500"/>
- Architectural style:
  - Provide a limited set of elements (components) and relations (connectors) from which a **view** of an app's architecture can be defined
  - An app usually uses a combination of architectural styles
### Styles apply to the logical view
- Layered (eg 3-tier architecture): doesn't reflect modern app's architecture: multiple entry/exit points
- Hexagonal:
  - Business logic at the center, has ports, interact with the outside via ports
  - <img src="./resources/2.2.png" alt="drawing" width="500"/>
  - Port:
    - Defines a set of operations
    - Usually interface
    - Types:
      - Inbound: API exposed by business logic (eg service interface), allow it to be invoked by external apps
      - Outbound: define how business logic invoke external systems (eg repository interface)
  - Adapter types:
    - Inbound: handle outside requests by invoking business logic via inbound port (eg MVC controller)
    - Outbound: implements outbound port, invoked by business logic and invoke external apps (eg data access object DAO)
  - -> Adapters depend on business logic
  - Advs:
    - Decouple business logic from presentation & data access logic in the adapters
    - -> Easier to test business logic in isolation
    - Flexible, reflect modern app architecture: multiple, exchangeable adapters
  - Usage: design each service in a microservice architecture
### Styles apply to the implementation view
- Monolithic architecture
- Microservice architecture:
  - Component: *service*:
    - With its own logical view architecture (usually hexagonal) & potentially separate technology stack
    - Implementation view can take many form (see Chap 12)
    - Correspond to business capabilities
    - Has an API to provide client access to its functionality. API consists of:
      - Commands: perform action & update data
      - Queries: retrieve data
      - Events: published by service, consumed by its clients
    - Size of service: mostly unimportant, compared to clear, focused responsibility of each service
    - Sign of well-designed service:
      - Can be developed by a small team with minimal lead time and collaboration with other teams
      - A team might only be responsible for a single service
    - Sign of badly designed service:
      - Requires a large team
      - Take a long time to test
      - Constantly need to change because of changes to other services or trigger changes in other services -> distributed monolith
  - Connector: communication protocol that services use to communicate, implemented using IPC mechanism
  - Key constraint: services are loosely coupled:
    - Services as units of modularity, API as boundary: all interactions with the service happen via its API
    - -> Easier to preserve modularity
    - Restrict how services collaborate: not via DB
    - -> Each service has its own database
    - Advs:
      - Encapsulate implementation details -> can change without impacting clients
      - Improve app dev time attribute (eg understandability, maintainability, testability)
      - Improve runtime isolation: can't lock DB of other services
  - Unit of reuse: service. Shared libs should only be used for functionality that is unlikely to change.
### Steps to define an app's microservice architecture
- Not a process to follow mechanically, but likely to be iterative and requires creativity
- <img src="./resources/2.5.png" alt="drawing" width="500"/>
- Step 1: identify the system operations:
  - System operation def: abstraction of a request that the app must handle. Can be either:
    - Command: update data
    - Query: retrieve data
  - <img src="./resources/2.6.png" alt="drawing" width="500"/>
  - Steps:
    - Create a high-level domain model: by analyzing the nouns in the user stories/scenarios and talking to domain experts
    - -> Result: domain models containing classes
    - Define system operations:
      - <img src="./resources/tab-2.1.png" alt="drawing" width="500"/>
      - Derive from verbs in user stories
      - Describe the operation's behavior in terms of effect on domain objects and their rela:
        - Create, update, delete domain objects
        - Create/destroy rela between them
- Step 2: define services by *business capability*:
  - Adv: business capabilities are stable -> resulting architecture is stable
  - The resulting services are only the first attempt at defining the architecture
  - -> May evolve over time as more is learned about the domain:
    - Combine services due to excessive IPC
    - Split services due to high complexity
  - Use domain driven design (DDD) as an alternative:
    - Domain def: app's problem space
    - Define a separate domain model for each subdomain -> service correspond to subdomain
    - Identify subdomain by business capability
  - Decomposition design issues:
    - Network latency: combine service to reduce IPC
    - Sync IPC reduces availability: use async messaging
    - Managing data consistency: distributed trans or saga
    - Obtain a consistent view of the data: rarely a problem in practice
    - God classes prevent decomposition: apply DDD and use a separate domain model for each service
    - -> Each service has its own domain model with its own version of the god class
- Step 3: define service APIs: steps:
  - Assign system operations to services
  - Determine the APIs required to support collaboration between services for each system operation: independent of IPC technology
