## 11. Developing production-ready services
- Problem: ensure quality attributes before deploying in production: security, configurability, observability
### Security: authentication & authorization
- 4 aspects of security:
  - Authentication
  - Authorization: apps often use role based security with access control lists (ACLs)
  - Auditing
  - Secure interprocess communication (eg services communicate over TLS with authentication)
- Monolith security approaches:
  - Session-based:
    - Session: store principal ID & role in:
      - Memory: require requests to be routed to the same instance
      - DB
    - Session token: used to identify the session. Usually opaque token. Can be:
      - Cryptographically strong random number
      - Store of session state
    - Steps: login -> server returns session token -> client includes token in each subsequent request -> server
  - API client: use API key & secret in every request
- Microservice security:
  - Authentication:
    - Approach: centralize authentication in the API gateway before forwarding to the services
    - <img src="./resources/11.3.png" alt="drawing" width="500"/>
    - Advs:
      - One place to implement -> safe effort
      - Hide complexity of dif auth mechanisms from the services
  - Authorization:
    - Where to implement:
      - Authorize in the API gateway:
        - Advs:
          - One place to implement
          - Can reject requests before forwarding to services
        - Disadvs:
          - Coupling API gateway to the services
          - Can only implement role-based authorization, not ACLs
      - Authorize in the services (standard way) -> can do both role-based & ACLs
    - Types of tokens:
      - Opaque token (eg UUID):
        - Adv: can be revoked
        - Disadv: reduce performance, availability & increase latency:
          token recipient must validate token via a sync RPC call to security service
      - Transparent token (eg JWT) (standard way):
        - Approach: API gateway & services use the token to pass around info about the principal
        - Adv & disadv: reverse of opaque token
        - Solution to irrevocable problem: issue token with short expiration times
        - -> New problem: app must continually reissue JWTs to keep the session active
        - -> Use OAuth 2.0 security standard
### Configuration
- Problem: dif config properties for dif envs
- 2 approaches for externalized config:
  - Push model:
    - Deployment infra passes the config properties to the service instance using OS env var or configuration file
    - Adv: simple to implement
    - Disadvs:
      - Reconfig a running service is difficult
      - Can't reuse a config that is common to many services
    - -> Pull model
  - Pull model:
    - Service instance reads its config properties from a configuration server (eg on start up)
    - Types of config server:
      - Version control system (eg Git)
      - DB
      - Specialized config server
    - Advs:
      - Centralized config:
        - Easy to manage
        - Can have override-able global defaults to avoid duplicate common properties
      - Transparent decryption of sensitive data: encrypt/decrypt can be handled by config server before returning to service
      - Dynamic reconfig (eg via polling)
    - Disadv: increased complexity: another highly available component that needs to be setup & maintain
    - -> Use open source frameworks
### Observability
- Goal: make the service easier to manage & trouble shoot
- <img src="./resources/11.9.png" alt="drawing" width="500"/>
- Aspects:
  - Health check:
    - Service exposes health check API endpoint which returns the health of the service
    - Goal: service instance can tell the deployment infra whether it can handle requests
    - -> Deployment infra can take appropriate actions:
      - Route requests to dif instances
      - Terminate/restart the instance
    - Design issues:
      - Implement health check endpoint: request handler checks service instance's connections to external service (eg DB, message broker)
      - Invoke health check endpoint: depend on details of deployment infra
  - Log aggregation:
    - Aggregate logs of all services in a centralized database that supports searching & alerting
    - Logging infra functions:
      - Aggregate logs
      - Store logs
      - Enable users to search
    - Design issues:
      - Choose log lib
      - Decide where to log: stdout
      - -> Let deployment infra handle
  - Distributed tracing:
    - Goal: see how the services interact during the handling of external requests, including a breakdown of where the time is spent
    - Mechanism: assign each external request a unique ID and record how it flows through the system (eg timestamps, tree of service calls)
    - -> Unique req ID also help with searching logs related to an external request
      in a centralized server that provides visualization and analysis
    - Components:
      - Distributed tracing lib:
        - Function: build the tree of spans & send to distributed tracing server
        - Used by each service by:
          - Call directly in code
          - AOP
      - Distributed tracing server: combine the spans to form a complete trace & store in DB
  - Application metrics:
    - Service report metrics to a central server that provides aggregation, visualization & alerting
    - Goal: monitor service health & alert when there is problems
    - Types:
      - Infra-level metrics: eg CPU, memory, disk utilization
      - App-level metrics: eg request latency, QPS, num of requests
    - <img src="./resources/11.14.png" alt="drawing" width="500"/>
    - Properties of a metric sample:
      - Name
      - Value
      - Timestamp
      - Other dimensions (name-value pairs)
    - Dev responsibility:
      - Add metric collection code
      - Send metric to metric service. 2 approaches:
        - Push model: service instances invoke Metrics service API
        - Pull model: Metric service (or its agent running locally) invokes a service API to retrieve metrics from the service instance
  - Exception tracking:
    - Disadvs of logging exception to log file:
      - Can't handle multiple line exceptions
      - Don't have a mechanism to track the resolution of exceptions
      - No automatic mechanism to deduplicate exceptions
    - -> Need a centralized Exception service
    - Service report exceptions to a central service that de-duplicates exceptions, generates alerts & manages their resolution
    - Approaches for service to report exception:
      - Call Exception service's API directly
      - Use client lib provided by Exception service
  - Audit logging:
    - Record each user actions in a DB
    - Goal: help CS, ensure compliance, detect suspicious behavior
    - Record information:
      - User identity
      - Action performed
      - Business objects
    - Ways to implement:
      - Add audit logging code to business logic. Disadvs:
        - Reduce maintainability: intertwine audit logging code with business logic
        - Error prone: dev writing audit logging code
      - AOP:
        - Adv: automatic -> more reliable
        - Disadv: lack of details
      - Event sourcing:
        - Adv: automatically provide an audit log for create & update operation
        - Disadv: doesn't record queries
### Microservice chassis & service mesh
- *Microservice chassis*:
  - Adv: reduce dev effort
  - Disadv: need one for every language/platform used to write services
- *Service mesh*:
  - <img src="./resources/11.17.png" alt="drawing" width="500"/>
  - Help simplify the chassis: only implement concerns tightly integrated with app code (eg externalized config, health checks)
