## 13. Refactoring toward deeper insight
- Process:
  - Step 1: identify the problems: could be in:
    - Complexity/awkwardness in the code
    - Language of the model seems disconnected from the domain experts
    - New requirements are not fitting in naturally
    - New understanding of the domain
  - -> The most difficult & uncertain part of refactoring toward deeper insight
  - Step 2: refine the model to make it communicate clearly & naturally:
    - Can be a small change
    - Can be a bigger change that involves more skilled devs & domain experts & requires several meetings (2-3 at most)
- Step 3: design:
  - Seek refs from domain literature/analysis patterns
  - Aim for supple design
- Best practices:
  - Should be able to assemble a small team on the fly to solve the problem
  - Pick an appropriate scope
  - Use & refine the ubi lang with the help of domain experts
  - Create a process that embraces necessary refactoring & doesn't require elaborate justification
  - -> Refactoring should be part of an exploratory process
- Evolution process is non-linear (see breakthrough) & usually emerges in the form of a crisis (inadequacy in the model)
