## 11. Applying analysis patterns
- Def
- Chars:
  - Higher level & more specialized compared to building blocks/design principles
  - Handle subtleties & help avoid costly mistakes
  - Not out of the box solutions
  - -> Need to refactor & experiment
- Includes:
  - Modeling
  - Impl
  - Deployment & long-term maintenance
- Analysis patterns explained via examples
- -> Goal: not go into details of analysis patterns but to illustrate their integration into the DDD process
- Advs:
  - Starting modeling point
  - -> Need to adapt to circumstances
  - Provide cleanly abstracted vocab
  - Stimulate refactoring toward deeper insight & development
  - Help understand long term consequences of dif impls
  - Show & facilitate refactoring the blind spots (parts of the program that started simply & evolved mechanistically)
- Best practices: keep the concept from analysis patterns intact to facilitate comm & make use of the embed understanding

### Additional info
- Make explicit event-firing mode concept
- -> Identify an easily overlooked challenge and provide vocab to support clear discussion
