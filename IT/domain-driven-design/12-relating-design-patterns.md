## 12. Relating design patterns to the model
- Distinction:
  - Domain pattern: intended specifically for solving problems in a domain model in the context of a model-driven design
  - Design pattern: descriptions of comm objects & classes customized to solve a general design problem in a particular context
- 2 views of design patterns:
  - Technical design patterns in the code
  - Conceptual patterns in the model because they correspond to general concepts that emerge in many domains
- Usage:
  - Consequences of application & impl approaches & other discussion of the technical pattern
  still applies fully when used as a domain pattern
  - Need to consider whether the pattern really fit the domain concept
- Strategy usage: separate:
  - Varying part of a process
  - A rule & the behavior it governs
