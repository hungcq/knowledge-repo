# Cloud Front
- Content delivery network (CDN): cache content at edge locations
- Advs:
  - Improve read performance & UI
  - DDoS protection, integration with Shield (AWS web app firewall)
- Origins:
  - S3:
    - Enhanced security with Origin access control (OAC - replacing OAI origin access identity)
    - Can be used as ingress (to upload files to S3)
  - Custom origin (HTTP):
    - Application load balancer/EC2 instance (security group must allow public IPs of edge locations)
    - S3 website (must enable static website hosting)
    - Any HTTP backend
- Geo restriction:
  - Def: allow users from specific countries (determined via geo-IP database) to access the distribution
  - Via: allow list/block list
  - Use case: compliance with laws to control access to content
- Pricing:
  - Cost of data transfer per edge location varies
  - Price classes: reduce num of edge locations for cost reduction:
    - All: all regions
    - 200: most regions, excluding expensive regions
    - 100: only the least expensive regions (NA, EU)
- Cache invalidation: force partial/full cache refresh to bypass TTL of all files (*) or specific path/file (/images/*)

# Global Accelerator
- Unicast vs anycast IPs:
  - Unicast: 1 server holds 1 IP
  - Anycast: all servers hold 1 IP, client routed to nearest server
- Global accelerator:
  - Leverage AWS internal network to route traffic to app
  - Flow: user -> AWS edge location -> app (via private network)
  - Create 2 anycast IPs for app -> can change BE without impacting end users
  - Work with public/private: elastic IP, EC2, ALB, NLB
  - Health check & automatic failover
  - Security:
    - Only need to whitelist 2 external IPs
    - Utilize AWS Shield for DDoS protection
