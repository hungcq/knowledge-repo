# Identity & access management (IAM)
- Group: contain users, not group
- 1 user can belong to 0 -> n group
- Policy:
  - JSON doc: define permissions
  - -> Least privilege principle: give users only the needed permissions
  - Group vs inline policy: for 1 user
  - Components:
    - Version
    - ID
    - Statement:
      - Sid
      - Effect: allow/deny
      - Principal (map): user/account/role
      - Action: array allow/deny actions
      - Resource: array
      - Condition: when to apply
- Password policy:
  - Length
  - Specific character types
  - Allow users to change password
  - Password expiration
  - Password reuse prevention
- MFA = password + security device. Types of devices:
  - Virtual (eg Google Auth, Authy)
  - Universal 2nd factor (U2F) security key
  - Hardware key fob
- Access via:
  - Management console: use password + MFA
  - CLI: use access key
  - SDK (libs for code): use access key
- Access key: managed by users. Components:
  - ID: ~username
  - Secret: ~password
- Role: assign permissions to services
- Security tools (for audit):
  - Credentials report (account level): list users & status of their credentials
  - Access advisor (user level): service permissions granted & last access of those services
- Best practices:
  - Root account: shouldn't be used or shared, except for AWS account setup
  - 1 user ~ 1 person in org
  - Assign users to groups & assign permissions to groups
  - Create strong password policy
  - Use & enforce MFA
  - Use roles to give permissions to services
  - Use access key for programmatic access (CLI/SDK)
  - Audit permissions using security tools
