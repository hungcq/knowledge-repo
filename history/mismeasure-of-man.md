# Superintelligence

## Info
- Type: book
- Author: Stephen Jay Gould

## Category
- History
- Science

## Structure


## Goals


## Style
- Ack by author:
  - Difficult subject, many uncertainty
  - -> Missing/wrong points could invalidate the conclusions
  - Focus more on risks instead of benefits: more urgent, existential issue
- Expository, casual, highly readable, with good sense of humor
- Highly futuristic but with good reasoning
- Useful introduction at the beginning of each chapter
- Ack of differing individual capability

## Recurring themes
- Accelerated development: once a higher level of intelligence is reached
- -> Convergence

## Terms

## Criticism
- Lack of consideration regarding unexpected movement that slowdown/stop the progress: eg conflict, war
- Solving large scale problem (eg world control) is not easy, even for SI
- -> Might require lots of experiments over a long timescale
- There is an assumption that certain kinds of perverse instantiation are bad, but it is not necessarily true (eg maximizing pleasure)
- Chap 11 goes to far into the future, read like science fiction. The basic assumptions are not solid.
- Chap 11: arguments about population increase seems ungrounded

## Takeaway
- Sense of progress
- Similarity of trivial, lack of evidence conclusions in the past with modern psychology
- Misunderstanding of major theories in their early day -> lasting social impact
