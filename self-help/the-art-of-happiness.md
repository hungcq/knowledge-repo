### Introduction
- Communication philosophy: relate to other as another human being, focus on the similarity instead of the difference
- DL's view about science
- Principles:
  - Hope that genuine and lasting happiness can be achieved
  - Believe in common goodness in all human beings
- -> Formed by sound reasoning, rational discussion & broad direct experience
- -> Wise approach to deal with human problem that is both optimistic & realistic

### 1. The right to happiness
- Happiness is the ultimate goal
- Mind def: include intellect & feeling
- Happiness can be achieved through training of the mind: to apply inner discipline
- Training steps:
  - Identify factors which lead to happiness & and those which lead to suffering
  - Cultivate happiness factors & eliminate suffering factors
- Experiments demonstrate that happy people exhibit certain quality of openness, willingness to help others

### 2. The sources of happiness
- Baseline level of happiness = genetical, moment to moment happiness = perception
- Change > absolute level
- People always compare with others
- 4 factors of fulfillment/happiness: wealth, worldly satisfaction, spirituality, enlightenment
- Basic external factors for happiness: good health, wealth, companions
- -> Need good state of mind to fully utilize the favorable factors
- Peaceful mind is not insensitivity: can still have feeling
- Internal sources of happiness:
  - Inner contentment:
    - Desire for necessary thing from rational thought > impulsive desire
    - Consequences of excessive greed: frustration, disappointment, confusion
    - How to achieve: want & appreciate what we have
  - Inner worth: source: able to relate to other people

### 3. Training the mind for happiness
- Causal principle -> seek/avoid causes/conditions that give rise to happiness/suffering
- 2 types of mental states:
  - Hostile to others: hatred, jealousy, anger -> negative
  - Relate to others: kindness, compassion -> positive, lead to happiness
- Neuroplasticity -> changing thought habit is possible
- Disciplines:
  - Mental discipline: avoid negative reaction: need a variety of approaches to deal with & overcome the varied negative mental states
  - -> Need education & training to get used to the techniques
  - Ethical discipline: perform wholesome actions & avoid indulging in unwholesome action:
    - Wholesome action def: action arises from a disciplined state of mind
    - Counter-argument: why training is needed if human naturally pursue happiness?
    - -> Answer: natural reaction is for short term goal -> need rational consideration to know what is good in the long term

### 4. Reclaiming our innate state of happiness
- Buddha Nature doctrine: underlying nature of human is gentleness
- -> Can adopt the belief without resort to the doctrine: gentleness is good for physical health & development, good for society
- To resolve conflict: need warm heart (where does this come from? Genetical?) & knowledge
- Compassion tendency is the result of nature & nurture -> not that convincing
- Should keep reminding ourselves of happiness as the ultimate goal

### 5. A new model for intimacy
- How to connect with others:
  - Try to look for their positive aspects
  - Not fear of being disliked/judged by others
  - -> Need to understand true value of compassion -> will do it automatically
  - -> Will overcome feeling of isolation/loneliness
  - Empathize with others: try to imagine the suffering of other (close) people
  - Look from the other person's perspective
  - Understand & appreciate the bg of others
  - Being open-minded & honest
- Benefits of intimacy: promote physical & psychological well-being
- How to achieve intimacy: take a boarder perspective: recognize the many sources of intimacy nearby, not only Special someone
- Ways to accumulate Merit:
  - Generate respect, faith, confidence in the Buddhas (Enlightened beings)
  - Practice kindness, generosity, tolerance... & restraint from killing, stealing, killing...
- Romantic notion of "one special person" is a product of culture
- -> Problems: cutting people from other potential sources of intimacy, cause unhappiness when that someone is not there

### 6. Deepening our connection to others
- To understand relationship problems, need to deliberately reflect on the underlying nature & basis of the relationship

## Criticism
- While trying to present a way to achieve happiness, the question of what is happiness was not adequately addressed (p.14),
even mistaken with satisfaction
- Just a cheap self-help book, quickly written without doing homework
- Present the matter in a simplistic way, without accounting for the complexity (eg biological difference).
Matters are presented like: oh compassion is good for your physical and mental health, so you should definitely do it.
Just try to empathize with others, looking at things from their point of view, then you can connect to them deeply.
- Mistaking/trying to twist correlation with causation when presenting scientific studies
- -> Sign of cheap book
- Intro:
  - DL view of science: severely twisted:
    - Science start from observation, not doctrine/unquestioned premise (sorry, it's not stupid religion)
    - Cause seeking is human tendency, not Western science (too dumb to realize this?)
  - Fallback to previous life argument: cause seeking in a stupid, ungrounded, superstitious way
- Chap 2:
  - Should compare with shit stain to feel good?
  - Only account for the remembering self when discussing happiness. How about the experiencing self?
  - How about dissatisfaction as a motivation to improve current circumstance?
  - -> Why Buddhism has never achieved shit?
  - Self-worth depends on others?
  - The philosophers didn't define pleasure, they contemplated about whether to pursue it, you dumb fuck author
- Chap 4:
  - DL claimed that aggression is the result of misusing human intellect,
  but aggression is common in nature. No human intellect is required
  - -> Wrong view on nature
  - Knowledge & education is not accessible for everyone
  - Biology offers a much more complete view on aggression & coordination: game theory
- Chap 5:
  - State that understand true value of compassion is enough to do it, then chap 6 said that understanding the value is not enough
  - Yeah, human is cooperative species -> life depends on others. But most of these others are replaceable?
  - Suddenly switch from compassion to intimacy
- Chap 6:
  - Look from other perspective: common platitude, without any value
  - Again, biology offer a better explanation about romance (dopamine)
