## Goals
- Show what the mathematics is about,
and why it is necessarily the foundation of exact thought as applied to natural phenomena
- Non goal: to teach math

## Terms
- Pedantry: too much attention to details

## Style
- Author claim: focus to make the general argument comprehensible, details are only used as examples
- Full of illuminating historical stories
- Some examples require focused attention

## Main points
### 1. The abstract nature of mathematics
- Cause of failure in math education:
fundamental ideas are not disentangled from the technical procedure
invented to facilitate their exact representation in particular instances
- -> A mass of details not illuminated by any general conception
- Most obvious characteristic of math: applies to everything, apart from any particular feelings/emotions/sensations
- -> Abstract science
- Tendency of human thoughts: ascribe origin of individual sensations
to relations between the things which form the external world
- Why math is imp: science attempts to generalize and abstract away from particular sensation
  into general laws of the world of external events
- -> Need abstract mathematical ideas to describe abstract, formal properties of things (scientific description)

### 2. Variables
- Ideas of "any" and "some" things in algebra: use letters instead of definite numbers of arithmetic
- -> Enabled by variables
- Some def: anything between any and one only
- "Some" idea allows the presentation of relationship between dif things using more than one variable
- Idea of undetermined variables is much more imp in math, compared to the solution of equation containing them
#### Additional info
- Skillful mathematicians choose equivalent form of the relation under consideration
that is most convenient for immediate purpose
- Study of general properties of relation between pairs of numbers is facilitated by the use of xOy diagram

### 3. Methods of application
- Math simplicity of formula won't make the stated law true
- -> Must check the assumptions & relevance to the phenomena
- To apply math formula, need to have:
  - Clear theoretical ideas
  - Correct estimate of their relevant to the phenomena under observation
#### Additional info
- Practicality vs tendency towards abstract knowledge:
  - Practical man as a man who practices the errors of his forefathers
  - -> All advances are confined to minor technical details of engineering
  - Abstract dreamers: arrive at new point of view, which could give a more fundamental control over the forces of nature

### 4. Dynamics
#### Dynamic, dynamical explanation of phenomena
- Claim of dynamics: the various quantities of things perceptible to the senses
are merely our peculiar mode of appreciating changes in position on the part of things existing in space
- Dynamical explanation of phenomena: statements of general form
that such and such a substance or body was in this place and now in that place
- -> Laws of motion, ie law of changes of configuration of things, are ultimate law of physical science
- How a physical object is described in physical science:
without reference to anyone in particular or to any special modes of perception:
  - Geometrical elements by which the positions of bodies in space can be settled
  (eg lengths of lines, sizes of angles, areas and volumes)
  - Rate of changes of geometrical elements (eg velocities, angular velocities, accelerations)
  - -> Necessitated by the fact of motion and change
#### Application of math
- Deal with correlation between variable numbers which are supposed to represent
  the correlations existing in nature between the measures of these geometrical elements & their rates of change
- When variables are substituted by definite numbers: only in occasional testing of the laws by reference to experiments
#### Physical, scientific world view
- Implication of physical world view: events of such an abstract world are sufficient to explain our sensations
- Evidence of the existence of external physical world:
the world submitted itself to test & allow its events to be explored and predicted by the apparatus of abstract math ideas
- -> Inductive verification has a remarkable success, even though inductive proof is never conclusive
#### Vector quantities & vector addition
- Vector def: anything completely given by the determination of a magnitude and a direction
- Fundamental vectors of science: velocity, acceleration, force
- Vector presentation: a line drawn with the proper length in the proper direction on the arbitrarily assigned scale of magnitude
- Vector addition diagram: chief bridge over which the results of pure math are applied to the facts of nature

### 5. Symbolism of mathematics
- Symbols:
  - Function: as an immense simplification,
  representing an analysis of the ideas of the subjects & an almost pictorial representation of their relations to each other
  - -> Need training to understand
  - Adv: allow transitions in reasoning almost mechanically by the eye, which otherwise would need the higher faculties of the brain
  - Character: concise -> visible at once glance & can be rapidly written
  - -> Placed in immediate juxtaposition -> juxtaposition should have an imp meaning
- Algebraic form: 0 on the right side
- Parameters:
  - Result from combination of variable idea & algebraic form idea
  - Distinction between var & param: presented by letters at the end vs by letters at the beginning of the alphabet
  - Adv: generalization reduce the amount of arithmetic performed
#### Additional info
- Deliberate vs automatic thinking:
civilization advances by extending the number of imp operations which we can perform without thinking about them
- -> Operations of thought are limited, must only be made at decisive moment

### 6. Generalizations of number
- Real numbers: include integral, fractional & incommensurable numbers
- Incommensurable numbers fill the gap in fractional series
- 3 imp math ideas: generality, variable & form
- Positive & negative numbers as operations
- -> Generalize above countable things

### 7 & 8. Imaginary numbers
- Origin: due to equations like x^2 + a = b
- -> Goal: achieve generalization of a & b -> solutions +-sqrt(b - a) always have a meaning even if b - a < 0
- -> sqrt(-1) needs a meaning
- The interpretation of sqrt(-1) needs to meet ordinary algebraic rules (eg commutative operations)
- Proofs that the representation using ordered couples meets the rules: addition & multiplication
- Same formula for vector addition & multiplication
- -> Quadratic equation (ax^2 + bx +c = 0) can always be interpreted in terms of vector (calculus of vector)

### 9. Coordinate geometry
- Representation of a point in a plain by (x,y) coordinate
- Math deals with the general truths applying to all things
- -> Various branches of math undergo a perpetual process of generalization, then coalesce
- Coalescence of ideas in geometry & algebra:
  - Ideas of algebra:
    - Correlation between variable numbers
    - Classification of correlations into types by the idea of algebraic form
  - Ideas of geometry:
    - Variable points, satisfying some condition so as form to a locus
    - Classification of loci into types by the idea of conditions of th same form
  - Coordinate geometry:
    - Relate together geometry, science of space, with algebra, science of number
    - Identify algebraic correlation with geometrical locus
    - Alignment between 2 sciences:
      - The point on a plane is represented in algebra by its two coordinates x & y
      - The condition satisfied by any point on the locus is represented by the corresponding correlation between x & y
      - To correlations expressible in some general algebraic form (eg ax + by = c),
      there correspond loci of some general type, whose geometrical conditions are all of the same form
- Algebraic form of straight line: ax + by = c
- Idea of origin O in coordinates or vectors:
our first procedure in exploring the universe is to fix upon an origin "nearly here"

### 10. Conic sections
- Def: curves formed by cutting a cone with a plane:
  - Ellipse
  - Parabola
  - Hyperbola
- Properties
- Application of conic sections in astronomy
- Algebraic form of conic sections (only when they represent any locus):
ax^2 + 2hxy + by^2 + 2gx + 2fy + c = 0

### 11. Functions
- Def: a correlation between 2 variable numbers, called respectively the argument and the value of the function,
such that whatever value be assigned to the argument, the value is definitely (uniquely) determined
- -> Representable like other correlations by a graph (method of coordinate geometry)
- Denote: y = f(x): y is the value of some undetermined function of the argument x
- Continuous & discontinuous functions:
  - The most imp distinction
  - Discontinuous functions might be hard to present by a graph
  - For many functions discontinuities only occur at isolated points (eg y = 1/x)
- Def between old & modern math: precise definition:
  - Vague half-metaphorical terms like "gradually" are no longer tolerated in its exact statements
  - Only admit statements & defs & arguments which exclusively employ the few simple ideas
  about number & magnitude & variables on which the science is founded
  - Advs:
    - Necessary for accuracy
    - Necessary for research: allow clearness of thought
    - -> Boldness of thought & fertility in trying new combinations of ideas
- Continuity of functions & related ideas def:
  - Interval of values of argument x of f(x): all the values lying between some two values of x
  - A set of numbers approximates to a number a within a standard k
  when the numerical difference between a & every number of the set is less than k
  - -> k: standard of approximation k
  - Neighborhood: values of f(x) possess a characteristic in the "neighborhood of a" when some interval can be found, which:
    - Contain the number a not as an endpoint
    - Every value of the function for arguments, other than a, lying within that interval possesses the characteristic
    The value f(a) of the function for the argument a may or may not possess the characteristic
  - In the neighborhood of a, f(x) approximates to c within the standard k when some interval can be found, which:
    - Include a not as an endpoint
    - All values of f(x) where x lies in the interval and is not a, differ from c by less than k
  - Continuity: f(x) is continuous  at a value a of its argument
  when in the neighborhood of a its values approximate to f(a) within every standard of approximation (any k)

### 12. Periodicity in nature
- Periodicity def: successive events so analogous to each other that they may be termed recurrences of the same event
- -> Nature is dominated by the existence of those events
- Imp role of periodicity in conception of life:
  - Conception of experience as a guide to conduct
  - Time as a quantity
- Underlying assumption of astrological periodicity: laws of motion are exactly verified
- -> Astronomical phenomena are only used as reference
- Implication to math: to be a fit instrument for the investigation of nature,
need to be able to express essential periodicity of things
#### Additional info
- Determination of the broad general consistency of the imp periodicities (eg motion of planets)
was the first step in natural science

### 13. Trigonometry
- Origin: triangularization process in map-making
- Main problem of trigonometry: given the magnitudes of the angles of a triangle,
what can be stated as to the relative magnitudes of the sides
- Sine & cosine:
  - Def
  - Period = 2pi
- Periodic function def: f(x) is periodic with period a if:
  - For any value of x, f(x) = f(x + a)
  - There is no number b smaller than a such that for any value of x, f(x) = f(x + b)
- Fourier theorem (imp to abstract theory of periodic functions):
if f(x) be a periodic function with period a and if f(x) satisfied certain conditions,
then f(x) can be written as the sum of a set of terms in the form:
  - c0 + c1 x sin(2pi x / a + e1) + c2 x sin(2pi x / a + e2) + ...
- -> Result: harmonic analysis of the function: x represent particular time
- -> Deal with natural fact of periodicity

### 14. Series
- Def: a set of things ranged in order/sequence
- Series summation: symbolize the fundamental process of approximation
- Limit:
  - For infinite series, we approximate to the limit of the summation of the series
  - Def: define a series s where sn = sum of terms of original series to n,
  l is the limit (ie sum to infinity) of the terms of series s1, s2, s3,..., sn..., if,
  corresponding to each standard of approximation k, a term sn of the series can be found so that
  all succeeding terms (eg sn+1, sn+2) approximate to l within k
- Convergent vs divergent series:
  - Convergent def: possess a sum to infinity
  - Uniformly vs non uniformly convergent in the interval a-b: we can always state some number of terms n such that,
  if we take n or more terms to form the sum, then whatever value x has within the interval a-b,
  we can satisfy the desired standard of approximation
- Series generalization:
  - Using a variable int n: f1(x), f2(x),..., fn(x),...
  - Function as limit of a series
  - Exponential (exp) function

### 15. Differential calculus
- Idea: the systematic consideration of the rates of increase of function
- -> Common in nature
- Coalesce with the problem of drawing tangent to curve
- Difficulty of definition & solution:
  - Limit def via neighborhood:
    - Notion: consider f(x) over the interval x -> h + x
    - x as a constant, h as a variable
    - Limit of f(h) at a as is a property of the neighborhood of a:
    f(x) has the limit l at a value a of its argument x,
    when in the neighborhood of a its value approximate to l within every standard of approximation
    - Def of continuity via limit: f(x) is continuous at a when:
      - It possesses a limit at a
      - The limit is equal to its value at a
- Derived function (differential coefficient) def:
the limit, if it exists, of the function (f(x+h) - f(x))/h of the argument h at the value 0 of its argument
#### Additional info
- Subjects of Integral calculus:
  - Rectification of curves: find the lengths of curves
  - Quadrature of curves: find the areas enclosed by curves

### 16. Geometry
- Scope of study: properties of the shapes and relative positions of things
- -> Science of dimensional order: a division of the more general science of order
- Abstract nature:
  - Ignore all particular sensations: particularity is only a character of the mind when reasoning about space
  - Ignore particular things: only used as examples
- Method of study: think of interesting simple figures and investigate correlations between their various parts
- Attempt to generalize introduce the ideas of variables

### 17. Quantity
- Def: a set of things (eg lengths) which are measurable in terms of any one of them
- -> Quantities of the same kind
- Quantity idea: the means by which a continuum (eg a line, an area) can be split up into definite countable parts
- -> Number can be used to determine the exact properties of a continuous whole
- Requisites of rule of quantity measurement:
  - General agreement with common sense: equality of the units
  - A definite rule for minute changes shall be stated which allows of the simplest expression of the laws of nature
- Quantity is the main application of the theory of numbers
- Physical science depends on the main ideas of number, quantity, space and time
