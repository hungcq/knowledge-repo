## Info
- Type: book
- Author: Nick Lane

## Notes
- Freeze egg: preserve mito gene
- DNA (double strands, in nucleus) -> messenger RNA (single strand) from nucleus to ribosome in cytoplasm -> protein
- Dif vs prokaryote:
  - Larger
  - More gene & non encoding segment
  - Gene structure: many straight chromosomes vs circular, complex membrane system & skeleton & organelles
- Host cell: methanogen, mito: ancestor of hydrogenosome - can do both oxygen & non oxygen respiration (produce hydrogen as waste)
- Why combine:
  - Efficient hydro generation
  - Gene transfer allow host to process food
  - Why go to oxygen env before losing oxygen respiration gene: competition with sulphur bacteria
- Cytochrome: protein containing Fe, bind to oxygen/carry electron
- Fermentation (no oxigen, produce acid lactic) & respiration: provide energy
- ATP: adenosine triphosphate, energy currency, can be stored in cell for hours
- ATP -> ADP + P + energy
- Electron pass through respiratory chain -> complexes in the chain pump proton across membrane, create gradient (pressure).
Proton later pass through ATPase (plucked into membrane), rotate it & synthesize ATP.
- Proton force also power other cell functions
- RNA as first living molecule: not a versatile catalyst; unstable, need energy to replicate, where usable energy? -> premodial soup
- Premodial soup from asteroid: problem with time gap between asteroid bombardment period & photosynthesis:
- -> No way to produce new organic molecule
- Fermentation:
  - Complex, requires many enzymes
  - Fermentation enzyme in bacteria & archaea is dif -> fermentation not origin from common ancestor
- -> Respiration as first energy-generating mechanism: require less components & simpler mechanism
- Respiration need membrane: inorganic, because bac & archaea have dif type of membranes
- Iron-sulphur minerals as catalyst to form organic molecules & as early membrane: allow electron flow & proton pumping
- Alkaline vent: create bubbles with pH dif -> only need ATPase to respire
- Why bac gene small: replicate faster, requires less energy to replicate 
- -> Dominate population; small gene compensated by lateral gene transfer for needed functions
- Why bac size small: higher surface/volume ratio -> efficient energy generation
- Why bac need cell wall: keep proton from dissipating into env -> efficient energy gen
- -> solve by mito: respire using inner membrane -> independent of surface area
- Gene transfer from mito to nuclear: quickly gain new functions
- Why gene remains in mito: to control membrane (number of complexes in the respiratory chain)
- -> Can respond quickly to changes in respiration demand - varies in mito.
Protein produced by gene in nucleus cant differentiate dif mitos -> cant response to demand of carrier in dif mito
- Why bac cant be complex: cant evolve big internal membrane system:
need to duplicate gene to stay near dif membrane sites to response to changes -> no immediate advantages -> selected against
- Why euka become bigger & complex (more gene):
  - Bigger cell with more mito: can move & engulf prey
  - Bigger cell require bigger nucleus to balance growth -> more DNA, some serve functions -> complexity
- Warm blood = gen heat internally
- Maximal metabolic rate increase with body size
- -> Selected for speed & endurance, correlated with resting metabolic rate (organ with more mito -> faster recovery after activity)
- -> Proton leak to gen heat to avoid forming free radical when no energy consumed at rest
- Cost of sex: need 2 parents, randomize successful genes of parents
- Cost of aging: lose out in population
- Selection of gene or cell:
  - Gene only encode products, how products are assembled depends on existing cell structure
  - Selfish gene: only in sexual organism (euka), not in bacteria (clone itself)
  - Selfish interest of cell (unit) must be suppressed for cooperation (by mito?)
  - -> Selection then act at level of the individual (same genome)
- Apoptosis:
  - Cell break up into small chunks, wrapped by membrane. Chunks engulfed by immune cells.
  - Mechanism: cytochrome C released by mito, activate caspase enzyme, slice up protein,
  some into other caspase, then break components of cell like DNA
- -> The mechanism was used by mito ancestor to kill host cell
  - Why kill host cell and kill itself (mito already lost its independence): at first, it creates sex.
  Mito in damaged cell (not replicate when food is plenty) leak free radical, damage DNA, lead to sex to fix DNA (selected for).
  - Why apoptosis evolved in single cell organism?
  Colony of cells with same genome remove damaged cells (urging to sex) - selected for.
  - -> How to reproduce then? Sequestrated germ-line as simple mean of reproduction (simple, selected for).
- How conflict of 2 group of mito after sex is resolved? Uniparental inheritance.
- Why 2 sex - half possible mate?
  - Mito (organelles) with dif genome compete -> throw away gene to replicate faster
  -> affect host cell respiration -> selection for uniparental inheritance.
  - -> How? Egg larger than sperm -> more mito in egg; remove entry for mito in sperm.
  - Mito gene subjected to natural selection due to: energetic efficiency, internal heat production, free radical leakage.
  2 sex allow selection 1 mito genome with 1 nuclear gene for compatibility.
  Incompatible eliminated early by apoptosis (in fertilized egg and in oocyte (pre-egg) in female embryo).
- Lifespan depends on free radical leakage in mito.
Free radical in damaged mito as signal for self correction
(produce more mito, increase stress resistance, but less resource to normal function) and apoptosis.
- Old age problem: some killed cells are irreplacable (neurons).
Old age disease gene: increase stress in cell, more likely to commit apoptosis.
- Reduce free radical leakage:
  - Target mito and not affect signal -> mito gene modification
  - Make electron flow down the chain smoothly - more exercise
- How bird reduce leakage: more mito -> more spare capacity for electron
- Why free radical restriction not selected? Fertility
