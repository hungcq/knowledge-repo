### Grow muscle
- Burn during exercise: good signal for brain & other parts of body. Should be in this state 10% duration of exercise
- Build muscle: need stress/tension/damage

### Burn fat
- 2 steps: mobilize out of fat cell into blood stream, then burn inside need energy
- Small, fidget movement trigger mobilization of fat: can burn lots of calories (800-2500 more each day)
- Shiver in response to cold: increase metabolism: http://thecoldplunge.com/

### Learning physical skill
- Is it open loop or close loop
- Where to focus on: error
- Repeat as many times as possible, esp error act, during first time learning the skill
- Focus on 1 particular feature of the movement, regardless of feedback
- Super slow motion: beneficial only after quite proficient (25-30% success rate)
- After: sit quitely, close eyes for 1-10 min

### Neuroplasticity
- Attention & focus: motivation & visual focus (stare at object of focus for 1-2 min, blink less). Rest 20 min after period of focus 90 min.
- Making error & incremental learning: appreciate error. Break after 7-30 min of frustration when facing error.

### Recover from injury
- Plenty of sleep, activity (min 10 mins of walking), heat, keep injured part active - reduce healthy part activity

### Stress
- Reduce short-term stress: physiological sigh: double inhale nose - exhale longer mouth to calm (help sleep also)
- Increase stress (more alert & focus, combat infection): inhale exhale fast 25 times, then inhale & hold breath for 30 sec
- Increase stress threshold (to adapt to medium term stress): dilate vision when experiencing high stress (eg when heart rate high)
- Reduce long term stress: sleep, exercise, social connection

### Hormone
- Dopamine schedule: celebrate wins (milestone reached), but not every win (randomly)
- Control eating & blood sugar: 2 type of exercise: aerobic & resistant
- Optimize growth hormone: exercise: have blood glucose at medium level, warm up, exercise 60 min, cooldown; sauna (xông hơi) 20 min, cool 30 min 2 lần

### Immune system
- Boost immune system: expose to short term stress (breathing, cold bath, < 60 min intense exercise, fasting) >= 3 times a week

### Performance
- Best performance when: highly alerted, a bit of stress
- Best learning when: intense focus, then increase in stress level (evo mechanism: learn immediate experience before stress event) - ultradian cycle 90 min also work similarly
- Improve physical performance & recovery: temperature is key: too high = cant contract muscle, will power low. Cooling: palm, bottom of feet, face by dipping in cool water
- Side hurt when running: do physiological sign: double inhale then long exhale

### Endurance training
- 4 types: muscular, long duration, high intensity interval training: aerobic & anaerobic
- Benefit of last 3 types: more oxygen & blood to the brain & muscle
- Improve performance: have a visual destination
