### Detailed structure
See table of contents

## Goal
- Provide clear insight into the means of modification & co-adaptation to support the conclusion:
each species had not been independently created, but had descended, like varieties, from other species
- -> Study of variation under domestication as the best approach

## Style
- Expository, with answers to counter-arguments & alternative theories
- Empirical: lots of observational evidence
- Strictly coherent: the chapters form one long argument
- Uncertainty & reservation exist in the conclusions
- -> Typical of scientific works?
- Chap 6 & 7: deal with the difficulties mainly by providing numerous evidence, esp of gradations

## Terms
- Horticulture: gardening
- Monstrosity: considerable deviation of structure in one part, either injurious or not useful to the species,
  and not generally propagated
- Struggle for existence: include dependence of one being on another,
not only the life of the individual but success in leaving progeny
- Mongrel: ~hybrid
- Variety < species < genus < family < order < class
- Affinity: close relationship
- Corporeal: physical
- Natural selection: the preservation of favourable variations the rejection of injurious variations
- Polymorphic: variations that are neither useful nor injurious -> fluctuating element
- Natura non facit saltus: nature does not make jump
- Instinct: an action:
  - Which usually require exp to perform, when performed by an animal, esp young one, without any exp
  - Performed by many individuals in the same way without knowing its purpose
- Stratum: layer of rock
- Palaeontology: history of life study using fossils
- Archipelago: collection of nearby islands
- Quadruped (vs biped): animal with 4 legs
- Genealogical: connected to line of ancestors

## Main points
### Introduction:
- Goal
- Outline of structure
- Conclusion
- Confirmation & ack of the unknown

### 1. Variation under domestication
- Causes of variability: less in condition of life than prior to conception
- Differences due to frequency of usage
- Correlation of certain characteristics
- Laws governing inheritance are quite unknown
- Domestic reversion to natural characteristics usually happens only when condition of life changes for many generations
- No systematic way to distinguish race from species
- Hard to know whether domesticated plants/animals descended from one or several species
- There should be role of inherited variation in creating new domesticated races
- Characteristics of dif pigeon breeds -> high diversity
- All pigeon breeds should descend from rock pigeon, with arguments against alternative explanations:
  - No other wild species has been found
  - Hard to domesticate successfully several species
  - Tendency to reverse to ancestor characteristics
  - Fertility of hybrids from between all breeds
  - Other observational & historical evidence
- Artificial selection for useful attributes -> dif between races
- Prevention of low-quality individuals from breeding
- Evidence of ancient selection practice
- Unconscious selection of the best variety is more imp to the investigation than methodical selection. Evidences:
  - Change in habit or structure follow human preferences
  - Dif mainly in external characteristics, not internal organs
  - No historical records because change is slow and small
- Circumstances favourable to man's power of selection:
  - High degree of variability
  - Large number of individuals being kept
  - Close attention paid to even the slightest deviation
  - Facility in preventing crosses in case of animals with separate sexes

### 2. Variation under nature
- Individual difs in imp parts do exist, though hard to observe
- No clear def & agreement on what should be ranked as species and varieties
- Species & varieties are only sth on the same scale of variation
- Wide-ranging, much diffused & common varieties vary most. Reason: dominant species will be likely to propagate advs to children
- Species of the larger genera in each country vary more frequently than species of the smaller genera. Reason:
  more species -> more materials to vary (multiplicative effect) (on average, not all cases)
- -> Species are not created
- Species in large genera are more similar to each other than those in small genera
- Group of species is generally centered around a parent species

### 3. Struggle for existence
- Problem: explanation for universal adaptation
- All organic beings are exposed to severe competition
- Imp of keeping the struggle for existence in mind to understand nature
- High rate of increase
- -> Destruction as a necessity to keep num of indi in check
- Scope of competition:
  - Within indis of the same species
  - With indis other species
  - With physical condition of life
- Limiting factors: competitions with other species:
  - Available food
  - Climate effects:
    - Direct effect
    - Lack of food
    - Favor other competing species
  - Epidemic: competition with parasite species
- Checks & relations between organic beings in the same area are complex
- Struggle between individuals or varieties of the same species is constant & severe:
same food, living area & risk
- -> Less between species of the same genus & of distinct genera

### 4. Natural selection
- Link between variation under nature and variation under domestication
- Requirement for natural selection: occurrence of profitable variations
- Natural selection can occur in balanced condition by new random advantageous char
- Nature has higher power of selection & more time to select than man
- -> Complex, adapted species
- Sexual selection as the main contributor to the dif between 2 sexes: accumulated adv chars to produce offsprings
- Adaptation & co-adaptation example
- Inter-crossing:
  - Benefits of inter-crossing
  - Occasional inter-cross with distinct indi is a law of nature
- Circumstances favourable to natural selection:
  - (1) Large amount of inheritable & diversified variability
  - (2) Large number of individuals
  - Not much inter-crossing
  - High rate of increase
  - Isolation -> subjected to the same condition, don't have to compete with other adapted species
  - Large area: more imp than isolation because of 1 & 2 & changing env
- Highly adapted species are more likely to spread & vary
- Isolation -> less severe competition
- -> Preservation of old, unadapted species
- Natural selection impact:
  - Acts very slowly
  - Often only at long intervals of time
  - Generally on only a very few of the inhabitants of the same region at the same time
- -> Due to the requirement of many favourable conditions
- Extinction
  - Less adapted form:
    - Reduced in number -> easy to go extinct due to env fluctuation
    - Adapt more slowly -> lose the competition
  - Formation of new species cause the extinction of others, esp those in close competition (eg varieties of the same species)
  - Why parent species became extinct: less adapted, less varied
- Divergence of character -> more ecological niche to take adv of -> not regress back

### 5. Laws of variation
- Effects of external condition:
  - Mainly from the change in reproductive system, which causes variations
  - Mechanism is unknown
- Effects of use and disuse:
  - Organs used frequently & being adv are naturally selected
  - -> The reverse with unused organs
- Acclimatisation (adapt to particular climate): species usually can live under dif conditions
- -> Dif in chars might be due to other env factors
- Correlation of growth of structure in dif parts:
  - Mechanism are unknown
  - Make changes in structure independent of utility & natural selection
  - Falsely identified correlation. Actually:
    - Inheritance
    - Natural selection
- Natural selection is continually trying to economise in every part of the organization
- -> Reduce useless parts & grow useful parts
- Specialized parts are less variable compared to rudimentary parts: easily punished for when not adv
- Parts developed in extraordinary degree or manner in comparison with the same part in allied species tends to be highly variable
- -> Natural selection in early stage -> have not yet converged
- Evidence of a common ancestor:
  - Distinct species present analogous variations
  - A variety of one species often assumes some chars of an allied species or reverts to some chars of an early progenitor

### 6. Difficulties on theory
- List of difficulties (see structure)
- Causes of the absense/rarity of transitional varieties:
  - Extinction of less adapted form & slow formation of new species
  - Possible explanations for the lack of transitional form in transitional area:
    - Areas might not be connected previously
    - Transitional area is small -> transitional species is small in number
    - -> Easily become extinct due to unfav condition/competition from other more numerous allied species
  - Lack of evidence is due to imperfection of geological record, which requires many favourable conditions
- Complex habits & structure: accumulated gradually under natural selection
- -> Evidence of gradations should be found more easily in collateral species, not in linear ancestors
- Difficulty of creationist theory on small gradations in structure
- Causes of organ of little apparent imp:
  - Slight modification might be of high, yet unknown imp
  - Unimp chars might arise from:
    - Physical condition
    - Correlation of growth
    - Sexual selection
    - Inheritance
  - Individual sacrifice for community

### 7. Instinct
- Comparison of instinct with habit:
  - Similarity:
    - Performed unconsciously
    - Modifiable by will
  - Dif: habits are not inherited
- Instinct varies & is also subjected to natural selection
- Cell-making instinct, with evidence of gradation, of the hive bee
- -> Perfection of the instinct help save wax, which is critical for the bees
- Being sterile could be selected if it benefits the community as a whole (eg division of labour)

### 8. Hybridism
- Goal: show that sterility of hybrids is not a specially acquired or endowed quality, but is i
- Dif between pure species & hybrids: reproductive organs is in good (vs bad) condition
- Infertility of hybrids is popular but varies case by case
- -> Of unknown cause or incidental on other acquired difs, mainly in the reproductive systems
- Variety is usually distinguish from species by fertility of hybrid
- -> Not a good indicator, leading to circular arguments
- Hybrids & mongrels don't differ that much
- -> Support the view that there is no clear distinction between varieties & species

### 9. On the imperfection of the geological record
- Intermediate form should be between ancestor & descendants, not between existing species
- Evidence of the age of the Earth
- Causes of the poorness of palaeontological collections:
  - Lack of research
  - Difficulty in preservation
  - Accumulation of fossils in formation in a rare occurrence
- Causes & example of imperfect evidence leading to wrong conclusion
- Possible explanation for the sudden appearance of groups of allied species in the lowest known fossiliferous strata:
state of continents & oceans used to be much different: continents as oceans & the reverse

### 10. On the geological succession of organic beings
- Restate the theory, with evidence from geology
- Explanation of geological & palaeontological facts by the theory

### 11. Geographical distribution
- Neither the similarity nor the dissimilarity of the inhabitants of various regions can be accounted for by their climatal
or other physical conditions
- -> Main cause of change: relation with other organic beings, not physical condition
- Imp of barrier to free migration in difference between species of dif regions
- Affinity of production of the same continent
- Explanation of why species exists in dif, separated areas: migration during periods where the continents were connected
- Adv modified chars slowly spread through the community
- Means of dispersal:
  - Change in climate force species to migrate & areas become separated afterward
  - Change in land: merged or separated later by the sea
  - Accidental means:
    - Seed carried by the wave through the sea
    - By bird:
      - In its excretion
      - In the dirt in its feet
    - On iceberg
  - -> Work on short distance & rare occasions
- Dispersal during the Glacial period:
  - Reason why Alpine species exist in separated summits
  - Southward migration during Glacial period: season why many species are similar in Europe & America continents: 
  - Ack of lacking in specific knowledge
  - Cannot explain affinities of southern species

### 12. Geographical distribution - continued
- Dispersal mechanisms of fresh water productions:
  - Change in land level -> rivers cross each other
  - Flood
  - Grate geological change
  - Adaptation of salt-water species
  - Accidentally carried by animals
- Inhabitants of oceanic islands: facts & explanations:
  - Small number of species: difficulty of migration
  - Many unique species:
    - Migration of whole group of species adapted to each other
    - Less competition
- Lower forms range more widely:
  - More time to migrate
  - Change more slowly -> less difference
  - Seeds & eggs are easier to transport
- Overall explanation of distribution:
  - Colonisation from the nearest and readiest source
  - Subsequence modification and better adaptation of the colonists to their new home

### 13. Mutual affinities of organic beings: morphology: embryology: rudimentary organs
- Naturalists usually use tree-like diagram for classification
- Rules of classification:
  - Based on common/rudimentary/atrophied organs, not specialized or vital organs
  - Chars derived from the embryo are more imp those derived from the adult
  - Influenced by chains of affinities
  - Def of orders, sub-orders, families, sub-families & genera are arbitrary
- Classification under the light of the Theory:
  - Amount of dif depends on degree of modification, not how far the species are in genealogical order
  - Law of descent is used implicitly in most classifications
- -> Support the theory
- Need to distinguish between real affinities and analogical or adaptive resemblances
happened because of similar env or random factors
- Extinction makes it hard to define the relationship by finding the common ancestor
- Morphology:
  - Several parts and organs in dif species of the class are homologous
  - -> Cause: inheritance
  - Dif parts in one organism are similar
  - -> Cause: repeated parts of low level ancestor are modified for dif purposes
- Embryology:
  - Facts:
    - Some organs of embryo are alike
    - Embryos of dif species of some class are similar
  - Cause: no adaptive adv in modification
  - Explanation of outlier cases in embryology: early dif has utility
- Rudimentary, atrophied or aborted organ: after many selected generation, reduced to rudimentary state by disuse

### 14. Recapitulation and conclusion
- Difficulties:
  - Perfection of organs & habits
  - Sterility
  - Geographical distribution
- Summary of the theory:
  - Variability under domestication
  - Natural selection
- Supporting evidence:
  - Variation as transitional state to species
  - Laws governing variation
  - Instinct
  - Geological evidence
  - Geographical distribution
  - Mutual affinities
- Causes of belief in creationist theory:
  - History of the world was thought to be of short duration
  - Geological record is assumed to be perfect
  - Slow, not visible variations
  - Long-held belief
- Extension of the Theory:
  - Confident guess: can be applied to the main classes
  - Prediction: can be applied all the way down to one primordial form
- Effects on study of natural history:
  - Distinction is not necessary, only nominally
  - Can have a basis for understanding when study/compare species
  - Amount of organic change can be used as an approximate measure of time in geology
  - Open up new interest & new field of research

## Criticism
- Sexual selection should not be limited to male
- Chap 8 has so many conclusions without any implications
- Some parts are a bit lengthy & repetitive

## Takeaways
- Much deeper understanding of natural selection & evolutionary biology, including theory, supporting arguments & difficulties
- Historical perspective on one of the best work of science & biology:
full of keen observations, sharp, critical & coherent arguments, careful & adequate treatment of most counter-arguments
