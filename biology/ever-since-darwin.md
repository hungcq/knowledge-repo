## Main content
- Darwin was reluctant to publish his theory due to his heretic materialist view
- Fitzroy captain authoritarian, traditional views as catalyst to Darwin thought
- Evolution (technical) vs progress. Darwin usage: descent with modification.
- Survival = expression, not def of fitness
- Human dif vs chimp: a matter of degree: traits, mental ability, genetic. Dif in regulatory genes.
- Tree vs ladder in evolution.
Allopatric theory of speciation: rapid evolution in small isolated population -> lack of fossils of intermediate forms
- Neoteny theory: as a general trend, not as a list of features. Long period of growth.
Availability of juvenile features as selection materials. Adv: social: learning & family tie.
- Altricial vs precocial mammals. Exception in primates: human baby as embryo: born early due to large brain size
- Selection pressure for display, not combat
- Reproductive strategies in stable vs unstable envs: K vs r
- Synchroneity of & long period between sex: predator satiation
- Gradual evolution: intermediate stages have other advs -> small change to serve new functions
- Ecology. Physical vs ecological theory in explaining Cambrian explosion. Cropping theory.
- Cambrian explosion as normal S curve growth function: no special event
- Reduction in habitable area (shallow sea) as a major cause of Permian extinction.
Ecology & geology (plate tectonic) explanation: gathering of the continents, reduced sea level, increased steepness at edges.
- Dogmatism and irrationalism as enemy of science, not religion
- Data are viewed in light of theory. Without a good theory data are explained away.
Data of continental drift theory, without plate tectonic mechanism, as a example
- Size vs shape. Surface area grows slower than volume -> remain small or adapt to support fast growing volume in large animals.
Negligible gravitational force.
- Constancy of cell size -> large brain of human allow more neurons
- Human skills & beha is highly adapted to body size
- Human brain as a deviation from brain size-body weight line.
- Vertebrate brain development to serve functional requirement of life, not a general tendency of evolution
- Gradual geological change: specific to earth due to size.
Internal (radioactive core) & external heat (retained atmosphere) as main cause.
- How rational, scientific a theory was should be view in light of its time & context. Preformationism as an example.
- Upright posture is more imp and precede brain evolution. Freeing the hand -> intelligence can be utilize.
Social prejudice of thinker class not recognized: brain role in human evolution as example.
- Recapitulation, neoteny: social prejudices & scientific racism, cherry picking data to support current popular theory
- Innate criminality: recurring arguments of biological determinism, theories have far reaching social impact,
prejudiced theory to maintain social order, blaming victims
- Subspecies to map geographic distribution: cant handle continuity & multiple features.
Multivariate analysis as an alternative. Implication for human races: outdated concept.
- Biological determinism: nature of species & nature of races/groups. 
Nature of species fallacy: analogous (convergent evolution) vs homologous (same genetical root) features.
- Resurgence of theories favored by social conditions, not new data
- Biological potentiality. Human behaviors explained in a cultural way, as opposed to genetical way.
Behaviors persist as adaptive ideas rather than genes.
- Success of Kin selection in explaining social, altruistic behaviors. Rejection of nastiness as animal tendency.
Limitation in explaining human behaviors.
- Pluralistic approach to nature: application to role of natural selection to genes, traits & behaviors
