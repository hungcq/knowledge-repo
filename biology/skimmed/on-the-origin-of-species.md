Biology, theoretical

# Style
- Expository, with answers to counter-arguments & alternative theories
- Empirical: lots of observational evidence

# Terms
- Horticulture: gardening
- Monstrosity: considerable deviation of structure in one part, either injurious or not useful to the species,
and not generally propagated
- Struggle for existence: include dependence of one being on another, not only the life of the individual but success in leaving progeny

# Content
## 1. Variation under domestication
- Causes of variability: less in condition of life than prior to conception
- Differences due to frequency of usage
- Correlation of certain characteristics
- Laws governing inheritance are quite unknown
- Domestic reversion to natural characteristics usually happens only when condition of life changes for many generations
- No systematic way to distinguish race from species
- Hard to know whether domesticated plants/animals descended from one or several species
- There should be role of inherited variation in creating new domesticated races
- Characteristics of dif pigeon breeds -> high diversity
- All pigeon breeds should descend from rock pigeon, with arguments against alternative explanations:
  - No other wild species has been found
  - Hard to domesticate successfully several species
  - Tendency to reverse to ancestor characteristics
  - Fertility of hybrids from between all breeds
  - Other observational & historical evidence
- Artificial selection for useful attributes -> dif between races
- Prevention of low-quality individuals from breeding
- Evidence of ancient selection practice
- Unconscious selection of the best variety is more imp to the investigation than methodical selection. Evidences:
  - Change in habit or structure follow human preferences
  - Dif mainly in external characteristics, not internal organs
  - No historical records because change is slow and small
- Circumstances favourable to man's power of selection:
  - High degree of variability
  - Large number of individuals being kept
  - Close attention paid to even the slightest deviation
  - Facility in preventing crosses in case of animals with separate sexes

## 2. Variation under nature
- Individual difs in imp parts do exist, though hard to observe
- No clear def & agreement on what should be ranked as species and varieties
- Species & varieties are only sth on the same scale of variation
- Wide-ranging, much diffused & common varieties vary most. Reason: dominant species will be likely to propagate advs to children
- Species of the larger genera in each country vary more frequently than species of the smaller genera. Reason:
more species -> more materials to vary (multiplicative effect) (on average, not all cases)
- -> Species are not created
- Species in large genera are more similar to each other than those in small genera
- Group of species is generally centered around a parent species

## 3. Struggle for existence
- Problem: explanation for universal adaptation
- All organic beings are exposed to severe competition
- Imp of keeping the struggle for existence in mind to understand nature
- High rate of increase
- -> Destruction as a necessity to keep num of indi in check
- Scope of competition:
  - Within indis of the same species
  - With indis other species
  - With physical condition of life
