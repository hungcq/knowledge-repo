- Free radical theory intro: free radicals as cause of oxygen toxicity & basis of oxygen chemistry
- Intro to the role of free radicals & antioxidants in biology
- Discussion about scientific method: specialization & imp of having inter-discipline big picture view
- -> Applied to oxygen research
## 2. In the beginning: the origins & imp of oxygen
- Problem intro: life adaptation to oxygen & implication
- Old theory about history of life (primordial soup) & relation with oxygen:
  - Early life forms  evolved without oxygen because organic matters can be oxidized
  - Photosynthesis activity of cyanobacteria increase oxygen level, cause oxygen holocaust
  - Toxicity & reactivity of oxygen keep atmospheric oxygen level stable at 21%
- Sum of new theory about evolution of life & geological evidence
- Ancient air composition & origin of modern atmosphere: volcanic activity
- 2 possible sources of oxygen:
  - Photosynthesis
  - Ultraviolet light splits H2O
## 3. The silence of the aeons: 3B years of microbial evolution
- Difficulty in understanding early history of life: lack of evidence: main source: fossils & genetic code
- Rejection of theory of evolution toward complexity: simple gene could replicate faster & dominate
- Microbes can be metabolically sophisticated & versatile
- Approaches to measure historical oxygen level & difficulties
- Links of rising oxygen level with eukaryotic success:
  - Symbiotic rela with mito
  - Clustering together of cells to deal with oxygen toxicity
## 4. Fuse to the Cambrian explosion: snowball earth, environmental change & the first animals
- Problem: why Cambrian explosion happened so suddenly
- Role of Cambrian explosion: diversification of segmented bilateral animals similar to modern day crustaceans
- Theories about ice ages (~750M years ago)
- Carbon 12-13 ratio evidence -> periods of diminishing & thriving life during & after ice ages
- High level of activity by cyanobacteria & algae due to high level of erosion of minerals & nutrients by glaciers
- -> Rising oxygen level
- Evidence of rising oxygen level
- Efficient oxygen metabolism -> opportunity for predators
- Role of oxygen in chemistry of structural components
- -> Necessary for large size & colonization of land
## 5. The Bolsover dragonfly: oxygen & the rise of the giants
- Difficulty in measuring historical oxygen level: possible contributing factors
- Biological structure & mechanism of flying insects
- -> Why high oxygen level enables large size
## 6. Treachery in the air: oxygen poisoning & x-irradiation: a mechanism in common
- Free radical chemistry
- Molecular oxygen structure & chemistry
- Respiration vs radiation: dif radicals, slower rate, restricted location, repair mechanism
- Similar protection mechanism to both oxidation & radiation
- -> Same mechanism applies to other stress factors
- -> Possibilities that protection against oxygen evolved earlier to protect against radiation
- Supporting evidence from Earth early condition
## 7. Green planet: radiation & the evolution of photosynthesis
- Problem in understanding evolution of photosynthesis: no immediate benefit
- Photosynthesis mechanism
- Early source of oxidative stress before oxygen: H2O2 formed in water by ultraviolet radiation
- -> Photosynthesis evolved from catalase which deals with oxidative stress
## 8. Looking for LUCA: last ancestor in an age before oxygen
- Prokaryote & eukaryote chars
- Evidence for LUCA:
  - Same DNA code & protein transcription mechanism
  - Same version of organic molecule out of 2 mirror version
- Mito chars & bacteria origin
- Dif between ribosomal RNAs of bacteria & eukaryote
- -> Early evolutionary divergence
- Similarity between Archaea & eukaryote
- Archaea live in extreme condition
- -> Lack of competition & motivation for change
- LUCA genes
- LUCA chars:
  - Metabolically sophisticated
  - Can do aerobic respiration
- Evidence of oxygen respiration:
  - Oxygen level doesn't have to be high
  - Proteins regulating & storing oxygen
- Antioxidants might have dif evolutionary function: regulate internal oxygen level
## 9. Portrait of a paradox: vitamin C and the many faces of an antioxidant
- Vitamin C mechanism
- Pro-oxidant mechanism: regenerate active form of Fe (Fe2+)
- -> Initiate free radical chain reactions
- Wider function & behavior of antioxidants:
  - Have repetitive molecular action, constrained by its chemistry
  - A single repetitive action can have many physiological roles besides an antioxidant effect
  - Antioxidant effect depends on env (eg other molecules)
  - -> Complex mechanism & interaction
## 10. The antioxidant machine: 101 ways of living with oxygen
- 5 categories of antioxidant defense:
  - Avoidance (sheltering)
  - Antioxidant enzyme (prevention)
  - Free radical scavengers: contain iron/copper which catalyses the formation of hydroxyl radicals
  - Repair: regenerate antioxidant like vitamin C
  - Stress response: activate inflammatory or antioxidant genes (eg to produce antioxidant enzymes)
## 11. Sex and the art of bodily maintenance: trade-offs in the evolution of aging
- 2 mechanistic theories about aging:
  - Programmed aging: aging is programmed in the genes, equivalent to other developmental processes
  - Stochastic: aging as an accumulation of wear and tear over a lifetime
- -> Both are not entirely true
- Aging is not necessary to life at bacteria level
- Difficulty in seeking evolutionary explanation: sex & aging don't benefit individuals
- Sex: masking DNA damage by recombination
- -> More efficient than selection by death
- Disposable soma (evolutionary) theory of aging: throwable body vs immortal germ line
- -> Tradeoff between sex & death: resources directed at reproduction is subtracted from bodily maintenance
## 12. Eat! Or you'll live forever: the triangle of food, sex and longevity
- Observation: aging is deferred until sexual maturation
- Selection pressure is low for problems occurring later in life
- Distinction between aging & age related diseases
- Theory of antagonistic pleiotropy:
tiny benefits from a gene in youth can outweigh dreadful afflictions later in life if the net result is more children
- Evidence against antagonistic pleiotropy
## 13. Gender bender: the rate of living and the need for sexes
- Inverse relation between the rate of free radical production and lifespan in mammals
- Mitochondrial theory of aging: aging as damage accumulated into mito DNA
- -> Not corroborated by empirical data
- Revised theory: a slight mismatch between the rate of free radical production and the ability of the cell to repair that damage
& a growing energy deficit lead to a decline in mito function
- -> Max lifespan limited by mito function
- Cell's age is limited by the length of chromosomes' tails (non coding DNA suited for replication mechanism)
- -> Only applied to cell grown in vitro, not related to aging
- Cells can reproduce indefinitely if they have active telomerase and a small number of inactive mito
- -> Lower oxidative stress
- Evolution of gender: select for undamaged mito
- Medicine goal:
  - Not to increase max lifespan: few people live to the maximum lifespan
  - Alleviate age related diseases
## 14. Beyond genes and destiny: the double-agent theory of aging and diseases
- Difficult concept of "working" gene: depend on env factor
- Basis of pharmacogenomics field: most diseases are predisposed by many genes
- -> Individualized treatment: consider the individual's whole genome
- Evolutionary explanation for why age related diseases are delayed until old age:
as people get older, risk of accidental death accumulates -> less evolutionary pressure to maintain physiological function
- Biological age as a function of oxidative stress
- -> Can prevent degenerative diseases by preventing oxidative stress
- Double-agent theory of aging:
  - Inflammation mechanism: infection -> oxidative stress rise
  -> inflammation attack to clear infection but also negatively affects health
  - Old age: leaking mito -> free radical & oxidative stress -> inflammation -> age related diseases
- -> Pleiotropic tradeoff: importance of inflammation mechanism for organisms earlier in life
- -> Alzheimer as example of the mechanism
## 15. Life, death and oxygen: lessons from evolution on the future of aging
- Book summary
- Clues about escaping age related diseases:
  - Infectious diseases: immunosuppression: reduce risk of age related diseases but also affect health negatively
  - Mito: less leaky & more efficient -> longer lifespan
- Discussion about current approach of medicine: lacking a hypo, focusing on details

# Criticism
- Too much detailed description of side arguments, while evidence & reasoning of main argument is thin
- Dif view compared to ones of later books: origin of life -> acceptable
- Some ideas repeated in other books -> acceptable
- Chapters on aging have too much speculation with little evidence
- Too many theories about aging, hard to keep track of
