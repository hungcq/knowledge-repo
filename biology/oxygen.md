# Goal

# Style
- Accessible
- One long argument, but chapters are mostly independent

# Terms
- Free radical: most biologically important ones are reactive forms of molecular oxygen, which can damage biological molecules
- Respiration: use oxygen to oxidize organic material (food), extracting energy for use & releasing CO2 back into the air
- Periods in earth history:
  - Precambrian period: before evolution of multi cellular life
  - Cambrian explosion: explosion of multi cellular life
  - Phanerozoic period: modern age of plants, animals & fungi
- LUCA: last universal common ancestor
- Salutary: beneficial
- Oxidation (vs reduction): removal of electron
- Sedimentary: rock formed by layers at bottom of lakes
- Limestone: đá vôi
- Vertebrate: động vật có xương sống
- Amphibian: động vật lưỡng cư
- Crustacean: động vật giáp xác
- Plaque: mảng

# Main points
## 1. Introduction
- Controversies around the role of oxygen
- Imp of oxygen in nourishing life
- Oxygen in evolutionary & organic biology
- History of discovery & medical applications of oxygen
- Adaptation & temp benefits of high/low oxygen level
- Free radical theory intro: free radicals as cause of oxygen toxicity & basis of oxygen chemistry
- Intro to the role of free radicals & antioxidants in biology
- Discussion about scientific method: specialization & imp of having inter-discipline big picture view
- -> Applied to oxygen research
## 2. In the beginning: the origins & imp of oxygen
- Problem intro: life adaptation to oxygen & implication
- Old theory about history of life (primordial soup) & relation with oxygen:
  - Early life forms  evolved without oxygen because organic matters can be oxidized
  - Photosynthesis activity of cyanobacteria increase oxygen level, cause oxygen holocaust
  - Toxicity & reactivity of oxygen keep atmospheric oxygen level stable at 21%
- Sum of new theory about evolution of life & geological evidence
- Ancient air composition & origin of modern atmosphere: volcanic activity
- 2 possible sources of oxygen:
  - Photosynthesis
  - Ultraviolet light splits H2O
## 3. The silence of the aeons: 3B years of microbial evolution
- Difficulty in understanding early history of life: lack of evidence: main source: fossils & genetic code
- Rejection of theory of evolution toward complexity: simple gene could replicate faster & dominate
- Microbes can be metabolically sophisticated & versatile
- Approaches to measure historical oxygen level & difficulties
- Links of rising oxygen level with eukaryotic success:
  - Symbiotic rela with mito
  - Clustering together of cells to deal with oxygen toxicity
## 4. Fuse to the Cambrian explosion: snowball earth, environmental change & the first animals
- Problem: why Cambrian explosion happened so suddenly
- Role of Cambrian explosion: diversification of segmented bilateral animals similar to modern day crustaceans
- Theories about ice ages (~750M years ago)
- Carbon 12-13 ratio evidence -> periods of diminishing & thriving life during & after ice ages
- High level of activity by cyanobacteria & algae due to high level of erosion of minerals & nutrients by glaciers
- -> Rising oxygen level
- Evidence of rising oxygen level
- Efficient oxygen metabolism -> opportunity for predators
- Role of oxygen in chemistry of structural components
- -> Necessary for large size & colonization of land
## 5. The Bolsover dragonfly: oxygen & the rise of the giants
- Difficulty in measuring historical oxygen level: possible contributing factors
- Biological structure & mechanism of flying insects
- -> Why high oxygen level enables large size
## 6. Treachery in the air: oxygen poisoning & x-irradiation: a mechanism in common
- Free radical chemistry
- Molecular oxygen structure & chemistry
- Respiration vs radiation: dif radicals, slower rate, restricted location, repair mechanism
- Similar protection mechanism to both oxidation & radiation
- -> Same mechanism applies to other stress factors
- -> Possibilities that protection against oxygen evolved earlier to protect against radiation
- Supporting evidence from Earth early condition
## 7. Green planet: radiation & the evolution of photosynthesis
- Problem in understanding evolution of photosynthesis: no immediate benefit
- Photosynthesis mechanism
- Early source of oxidative stress before oxygen: H2O2 formed in water by ultraviolet radiation
- -> Photosynthesis evolved from catalase which deals with oxidative stress
## 8. Looking for LUCA: last ancestor in an age before oxygen
- Prokaryote & eukaryote chars
- Evidence for LUCA:
  - Same DNA code & protein transcription mechanism
  - Same version of organic molecule out of 2 mirror version
- Mito chars & bacteria origin
- Dif between ribosomal RNAs of bacteria & eukaryote
- -> Early evolutionary divergence
- Similarity between Archaea & eukaryote
- Archaea live in extreme condition
- -> Lack of competition & motivation for change
- LUCA genes
- LUCA chars:
  - Metabolically sophisticated
  - Can do aerobic respiration
- Evidence of oxygen respiration:
  - Oxygen level doesn't have to be high
  - Proteins regulating & storing oxygen
- Antioxidants might have dif evolutionary function: regulate internal oxygen level

# Criticism
- Too much detailed description of side arguments, while evidence & reasoning of main argument is thin
- Dif view compared to ones of later books: origin of life -> acceptable

# Takeaways
