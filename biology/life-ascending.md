- -> Limitations
- New research techniques: molecular structure

### 1. Origin of life
- Question: origin of life: general rules:
  - Requirement: formation of organic matter
  - Hypo: extra terrestrial origin
  - -> Discourage research, contrary to rules of chemistry (quick chemical reaction -> life emergence is a necessity)
  - Hypo: primordial soup
  - -> Problems:
    - Thermodynamically flat -> No chemical reaction
    - Concentration problem
  - Hypo: black smoker:
    - Reactions:
      - CO & others -> organic matter (C,H,O)
      - H2S + Fe -> FeS2 + H2 + energy
    - -> Concentration problem
  - Hypo: alkaline vents:
    - Properties: porous -> allow concentration, catalytic, walled, have energy (reactive free radicals)
    - Prediction: existence of alkaline vent system -> corroborated
    - Reaction: H2 (plenty) + CO2 -> (via energy & catalyst - Fe, S) organic molecule + extra energy
    - Question: reaction happened that led to life:
      - -> Consider common properties of life
      - Kerbs cycle: organic molecule <-> CO2 + ATP + H2 (for respiration with O2 -> ATP)
      -> other side reaction -> other organic molecule (prediction)
      - -> Chemically & thermodynamically feasible
    - -> Question: where ATP in the reaction comes from?
    - -> Simple form (acetyl thioester) in vents
    - Question: how life escape from vents (as source of energy):
      - Question: ATP energy is atomic -> can't be formed in straight reaction: no extra energy saved for further reaction
      - -> Chemiosmosis mechanism: pump proton across membrane (proto gradients)
      - -> Build an ATP gradually
    - Consistency check: use proton, not other particles because of availability in vents:
    alkaline fluid + acidic oceans (dissolved CO2) -> natural proton gradient
    - Question: how to build gradient without proteins & DNA
    - -> must make use of natural gradient until able to build proteins & DNA

### 2. DNA
- Question: DNA evolution
- Question: how DNA code for protein (amino acid)?
  - Constraint: 20 amino acid (aa) -> 3-letter sequence needed
  - Hypo: overlapping sequence
  - -> Falsified by data: how aa appear in protein
  - Obs: DNA -> messenger RNA -> transfer RNA (20 types, bind to dif 3-letter codons):
    - Question: how transfer RNA bind to mRNA correctly/orderly
    - Hypo: only 1 per 3 cyclic permutations of codon is allowed
    - -> Disproved by aa AAA
    - Obs: redundant code, dif codons can code for 1 aa
    - -> Question: no adv in 1 code -> no selective pressure to arrive at 1 universal code
    - Obs: patterns in code:
      - First letter: precursor of aa
      - Second letter: degree of solubility in water
      - Third letter: carry no info
    - -> Hypo: 2-letter code, later expanded to 3
    - Obs: codes are resistant to change. If changed, there is little impact.
    - -> Hypo: selected, not random. Selection material:
      - DNA & protein: depend on each other -> not possible
      - RNA: can be both catalyst & inheritance material
  - Question: how aa built from code in RNA
  - -> Hypo: 2-letter catalysts
  - Question: how RNA was formed:
    - Hypo: origin of dNA:  
      - Outer space
      - Primordial soup
      - Volcano
    - -> Concentration problem
    - Hypo (theoretical, simulation): high concentration of nucleotides & RNA/DNA in alkaline vents
    -> (via thermal gradient) molecular reaction & replication
  - Question: RNA -> DNA -> protein, how protein was selected:
    - Obs: RNA world -> selected for replication efficiency, not complexity
    - Hypo: RNA + inorganic cells
    - -> Selected for cell metabolism & cell replication efficiency
    - -> Protein
    - Obs: archaea & bacteria: same protein synthesis mechanism & enzyme, dif DNA replication enzymes
    - -> Hypo: viral cells -> competitive adv for stable DNA -> RNA produced infect nearby cells
    - Obs: chemical formation of DNA is feasible given vents condition
    - Hypo: RNA -> (via reverse transcriptase, not DNA replication machinery) DNA
    - Difficulty: single origin of life
