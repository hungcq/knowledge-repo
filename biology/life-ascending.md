### 1. Origin of life
- Question: origin of life: general rules:
  - Requirement: formation of organic matter
  - Hypo: extra terrestrial origin
  - -> Discourage research, contrary to rules of chemistry (quick chemical reaction -> life emergence is a necessity)
  - Hypo: primordial soup
  - -> Problems:
    - Thermodynamically flat -> No chemical reaction
    - Concentration problem
  - Hypo: black smoker:
    - Reactions:
      - CO & others -> organic matter (C, H, O)
      - H2S + Fe -> FeS2 + H2 + energy
    - -> Concentration problem
  - Hypo: alkaline vents:
    - Properties: porous -> allow concentration, catalytic, walled, have energy (reactive free radicals)
    - Prediction: existence of alkaline vent system -> corroborated
    - Reaction: H2 (plenty) + CO2 -> (via energy & catalyst - Fe, S) organic molecule + extra energy
    - Question: reaction happened that led to life:
      - -> Consider common properties of life
      - Kerbs cycle: organic molecule <-> CO2 + ATP + H2 (for respiration with O2 -> ATP)
      -> other side reaction -> other organic molecule (prediction)
      - -> Chemically & thermodynamically feasible
    - -> Question: where ATP in the reaction comes from?
    - -> Simple form (acetyl thioester) in vents
    - Question: how life escaped from vents (as a source of energy):
      - Question: ATP energy is atomic -> can't be formed in straight reaction: no extra energy saved for further reaction
      - -> Chemiosmosis mechanism: pump proton across membrane (proto gradients)
      - -> Build an ATP gradually
    - Consistency check: use proton, not other particles because of availability in vents:
    alkaline fluid + acidic oceans (dissolved CO2) -> natural proton gradient
    - Question: how to build gradient without proteins & DNA
    - -> must make use of natural gradient until able to build proteins & DNA

### 2. DNA
- Question: DNA evolution
- Question: how DNA code for protein (amino acid)?
  - Constraint: 20 amino acid (aa) -> 3-letter sequence needed
  - Hypo: overlapping sequence
  - -> Falsified by data: how aa appears in protein
  - Obs: DNA -> messenger RNA -> transfer RNA (20 types, bind to dif 3-letter codons):
    - Question: how transfer RNA binds to mRNA correctly/orderly
    - Hypo: only 1 per 3 cyclic permutations of codon is allowed
    - -> Disproved by aa AAA
    - Obs: redundant code, dif codons can code for 1 aa
    - -> Question: no adv in 1 code -> no selective pressure to arrive at 1 universal code
    - Obs: patterns in code:
      - First letter: precursor of aa
      - Second letter: degree of solubility in water
      - Third letter: carry no info
    - -> Hypo: 2-letter code, later expanded to 3
    - Obs: codes are resistant to change. If changed, there is little impact.
    - -> Hypo: selected, not random. Selection material:
      - DNA & protein: depend on each other -> not possible
      - RNA: can be both catalyst & inheritance material
  - Question: how aa built from code in RNA
  - -> Hypo: 2-letter catalysts
  - Question: how RNA was formed:
    - Hypo: origin of dNA:  
      - Outer space
      - Primordial soup
      - Volcano
    - -> Concentration problem
    - Hypo (theoretical, simulation): high concentration of nucleotides & RNA/DNA in alkaline vents
    -> (via thermal gradient) molecular reaction & replication
  - Question: RNA -> DNA -> protein, how protein was selected:
    - Obs: RNA world -> selected for replication efficiency, not complexity
    - Hypo: RNA + inorganic cells
    - -> Selected for cell metabolism & cell replication efficiency
    - -> Protein
    - Obs: archaea & bacteria: same protein synthesis mechanism & enzyme, dif DNA replication enzymes
    - -> Hypo: viral cells -> competitive adv for stable DNA -> RNA produced infect nearby cells
    - Obs: chemical formation of DNA is feasible given vents condition
    - Hypo: RNA -> (via reverse transcriptase, not DNA replication machinery) DNA
    - Difficulty: single origin of life

### 3. Photosynthesis
- Reaction: energy + CO2 + H20 (via respiration) <-> (via photosynthesis + energy) O2 + organic molecules
- Photosynthesis mechanism: as a catalyst to separate O2 from H2O with minimal energy
- Main goal of photosynthesis: get electron from reducer -> form organic matter
- Question: cause of the switch from other easier electron givers (H2S, dissolved Fe - plentiful in early earth) to H2O:
  - Hypo: other material ran out
  - -> Falsified by geological record
  - Obs: photosynthesis product ATP alongside organic matter
  - Obs:
    - Similarity of all chloroplasts & similarity with cyanobacteria (DNA & structure)
    - Cyanobacteria is the only oxygenic photosynthesis bacteria
  - -> Hypo: cyanobacteria origin, endosymbiosis
- Obs: 2 photosystems in photosynthesis
- Question: how photosystems evolved in cyanobacteria:
  - Obs:
    - Similar photosystems between bacteria
    - Similar core structures between 2 photosystems
    - Photosystem I uses light to synthesize organic matter from an easy source (H2S, Fe)
    - Photosystem II captures light energy to make ATP
    - 2 photosystems can evolve naturally
  - Hypo: dif systems coordinated by a switch, which was disabled due to electron rich env
  - Obs: mineral cluster in oxygenic complex helps split water
  - -> Hypo: origin in vents, incorporated into photosystem

### 4. The complex cell
- Obs: euka life forms rapidly changed earth env & biological diversity
- Question: evolution of complex life, why it evolved only once
- Question: missing intermediate life forms:
  - Obs: big dif between euka & proka cells
  - Obs: some bacteria have some euka traits, but never all of them
  - Problem: build the tree of life:
    - Techniques & limitation:
      - Fossil record: missing records & bias animal with skeleton
      - Gene sequencing:
        - Lateral gene transfer & gene fusion
        - Difficult to know exactly how much change happened to a gene: only 4 letters
    - Obs: unique euka genes
    - -> No consensus about the rate of gene evolution
    - Obs: genes with bacteria equivalent: core process -> evolve slowly -> can build the tree of life
  - Obs from ribosomal gene sequencing: archaea dif from bacteria & close rela with euka
  - Obs: genes in euka common to 3 groups is a combination of bacteria & archaea genes
  - Question: source of euka traits: evolved before/after genes fusion?
    - Hypo: primitive phagocyte: evolving host cell, approaching euka traits, finally acquire mito
    - Obs: euka without mito, with chimeric genes -> lost mito
    - -> Weaken the hypo
    - Hypo 2: the reverse
    - Obs: all mitos retain some genes despite many disadvs: inefficiency, high mutation rate
    - -> Hypo: retained for respiration: locally control gene activity
    - Obs: area to volume ratio, need to duplicate genes to control internal membranes -> difficulty of getting big
    - Hypo: advs of mito: internal membranes & ability to control locally
  - Question: evolution & adv of nucleus
    - Obs: DNA contains non-coding sections (introns), originated from jumping genes
    - Obs: RNA scissors to cut introns before building proteins. Scissors operate slowly.
    - Hypo: nucleus to separate cutting from protein building
    - -> Adv: large genome, variation & complexity

### 5. Sex
- Obs: universality of sex in euka
- Disadvs of sex:
  - Biological cost, need 2 partners
  - -> Slow
  - Past only half the genes -> can't retain adv of good genome
- Question: why sex evolved? Why not clone good genomes?
  - Obs: meiosis mechanism, recombination
  - Hypo: sex allows the combination of 2 good genes of dif individuals & avoid degeneration from bad genes (Muller's ratchet)
  - -> Problem: group selection -> no evolutionary adv
  - Hypo: sex & recombination (genetically) are advantageous to changing env
  - -> Not supported by data
  - Hypo: sex advs against parasites
  - -> Only under certain circumstances -> can't explain universality
  - Adjusted hypo: sex also retains genetic diversity (simulation)
  - -> Imp for adaptation & also benefit individual
  - Hypo: early euka conditions:
    - High selection pressure: jumping genes destroy genome
    - Variable population & high mutation rate: impact of bacterial genes on host genome
  - -> Sex combine advs & allow survival
  - Obs: sex mechanism is not hard to evolve:
    - Cell fusion
    - Segregation of chromosomes
    - Recombination

### 6. Movement
- Obs:
  - Muscle consists of fibers with bands of dif density
  - Muscle contraction is triggered by electricity from the nervous system
- Question: muscle contraction mechanism
- -> Obs: muscle mechanism: myosin, actin (skipped)
- Obs: common ancestor of most animals has both muscle types & myosin
- -> Question: how actin-myosin mechanism evolved? What is the evolutionary adv?
  - Obs: actin in cytoskeleton (common to all euka cells) can bind to myosin heads
  - Obs: all variations of cell movement & inner transportation are based on the same mechanism
  - Obs (via crystallography): myosin & kinesin have similar structure despite dif gene sequences
  - -> Evolve from common bacterial ancestors
  - Obs: cytoskeleton mechanism (skipped)
  - Obs: all living euka is motile
  - -> Ancestor is motile
- Remaining question: evolution of motility in ancestral euka, source of the proteins

### 7. Sight
- Obs: dominance of species with eyes
- Question: evolution of rudimentary eyes:
  - Obs: eyes with retina and no lens are more sensitive to light
  - Obs: eyes start to appear in fossil in Cambrian explosion
  - -> Hypo: eyes evolution drive the explosion
  - Hypo: gradual evolution of eyes
  - -> Prediction: formed by reusable material
- Question: how lens evolve:
  - Obs: proteins used in lens are also used in other places, reinvented many times
- Question: evolution of light-sensitive cells of the retina:
  - Protein for sensing light in the retina is used across the animal kingdom
  - Hypo 1: common ancestor
  - Hypo 2: constraints -> convergent evolution
  - Obs: light sensitive cells of vertebrates & invertebrates have dif structures & neural mechanism
  - Obs: several genes can control eye development in both groups
  - -> Corroborate hypo 1
  - Obs: light-sensitive proteins exist in species close to ancestor of both groups, used for circadian rhythm
  - -> Common ancestor, diverge to dif functions
- Question: who was the ancestor?
  - Obs: visual pigments (opsin) in both groups exist in algae, in particular chloroplasts
  - -> Hypo: common ancestor: protozoa: engulfed chloroplasts

### 8. Hot blood
- Obs:
  - Heat retention is not difficult for large cold-blooded animals
  - Hot-blooded animals generate internal heat regardless of the env
  - Energy cost to maintain internal heat is high when temp is low
- Question: evolutionary adv of hot blood:
  - Obs: dif muscle types: power vs stamina tradeoff
  - Hypo: selection for stamina -> logically plausible
  - Obs: max rate = 10x resting rate
  - -> Hypo: resting metabolic rate is directly proportional to max rate
  - Obs: high mito density in organs of hot-blooded animals
  - Hypo: heat & hot blood as side effect of aerobic capacity
  - -> Obs: many exceptions to the link
  - Obs: 2 groups of reptiles are ancestor of mammal & bird respectively:
    - Therapsids:
      - Lystrosaurus: herbivore
      - Cynodonts -> mammal
    - Archosaurs:
      - Thyropods -> birds
      - Dinosaurs
  - Obs: reptilian ancestors of mammals have respiratory turbinates -> probably high resting metabolism
  - -> Hypo: hot-blooded
  - Obs: theropod dinosaurs have similar skin structure to birds -> likely to have feathers
  - -> Hypo: hot-blooded or high aerobic capacity
  - Obs: structure of theropod's heart & lung can also support high level of activity: 4-chamber heart, bird-like lung
  - -> Hypo: high metabolic rate, not necessarily hot-blooded
  - Obs: geological activities & atmospheric composition at that period
  - -> Hypo: carbon rich, nitrogen poor diet requires either:
    - Burn extra carbon from food
    - Use extra food to get bigger
  - -> Hypo: hot blood evolved from adv of high aerobic capacity & the need to burn extra carbon from green diet

### 9. Consciousness
- Question:
  - Mind/brain rela/interaction
  - How mind/brain evolved
  - -> Imp: involve human conception of their spirit
- Motivation for scientific study:
  - Deep mystery
  - Cure disease
- Consciousness def:
  - Core/primary (~animal): emotions, motivations, pain, rudimentary sense of self
  - Extended (human): awareness of self embedded in the world, society, culture, future projection
- Obs: extended consciousness: easy to explain given core consciousness: society, language
- Obs:
  - Unitary feeling: brain mechanism
  - Perception: via neural mechanism: encode, transmit, transform
  - Illustrations:
    - Damage brain -> reproducible result, ~animal, can affect consciousness
    - Direct brain stimulation/drug
- Hypo: consciousness is a result of brain activity, not an emergence property
- Obs: coherent perception produced by neurons firing in synchrony
- -> Hypo: a group of neurons fires at the moment of conscious perception
- Def: emotion: body states
- -> Map out by brain into feeling
- -> Map of feeling into external objects = consciousness -> human value
- Question: how the maps are built & relate to each other
  - Obs:
    - Map = group of neurons strengthened by experience
    - Strengthening mechanism: when neurons fire together
    - Role of genes: general brain structure & region development, not detailed architecture & connections
  - Obs:
    - Dif oscillation phases for dif aspects of a scene
    - Oscillation (reverberation) between distant brain regions
    - When a neuron fires, it depolarizes & can't fire again until it has re-polarized
    - Phase-lock mechanism: time taken for neurons to be able to fire again
  - -> Hypo: phase-locked oscillations bind when phases overlap -> higher level of consciousness = lower phase
- Question: how neurons generate feeling:
  - Obs: primordial emotions = feeling, serves survival/propagation purpose
  - Obs: feeling induces action -> physically selectable
  - Assumption: sense = input, feeling = output
  - -> Question: what is feeling in terms of matter
  - -> Hypo: feeling as new "conscious" property of matter
  - Hypo: feeling = result of quantum mechanic in the brain (vibration of proteins)
  - -> Not corroborated by obs of the brain's working
  - Hypo: selection on physical attribute of neurons
  - -> Feeling = pattern of neuron firing:
    - Feeling selection:
      - Realness -> survival adv
      - Immaterial feeling = inability to introspect brain's working = optimization: focus on outer-world -> selected
    - Difficulty of full expression by language = loss during neural firing & pattern mapping
    - Can be communicated = same firing pattern
- Obs: many animals with brain have feeling
- -> Hypo: consciousness arose from primordial feelings -> widespread -> can study animals

### 10. Death
- Question: evo adv of death
- Cell death:
  - Obs: genetically identical cells differentiate to adapt to the env
  - Hypo: programmed death mechanism evolved in bacteria:
  weak/damaged cells in genetically identical population suicide to ensure survival of the genome
  - Obs: differentiation (specialization) between germ-line & soma cells
  - -> Found in primitive colonies of cells
  - Obs: in all euka cells, death machinery is the same & inherited from mito (~cyanobacteria)
  - -> In multicellular organism: death ensures differentiation, punish transgression
- Question: aging & death in multicellular organisms:
  - Hypo: population selection, death benefits species
  - -> Not work for selfish gene
  - Hypo: no selective pressure after reproductive cycle -> accumulation of bad traits & antagonistic pleiotropy
  - -> Only explain age-related diseases, not aging & dying
  - Obs:
    - Mutations causing change in a single pathway extend lifespan & health of various species
    - Life-extending genes also control sexual maturation:
      - Env plenitude -> insulin -> body development
      - Tradeoff: resource for bodily maintenance vs resource for sex
  - Question: can lifespan be prolonged without affecting fertility?
  - Hypo: free-radical theory of aging: free radicals damage DNA & protein -> aging
  - -> Falsified by obs:
    - Antioxidants don't prolong life
    - Free radical is an imp signal of cell physiology: trigger apoptosis, not damaging cells
  - Obs: lifespan & health span ~ free radical like ~ metabolic rate in most mammals
  - -> Adjusted hypo: increased rate of leak from old, damaged mitos triggers inflammation mechanism -> prolonged mild stress
  - -> Either:
    - Cell deaths & increased pressure on living cells
    - Cells avoid death by switching to alternative energy source -> cancer
  - -> Age-related diseases
  - Obs: reduced free radical leaking (calorie restriction/gene mutation) increases life/health span in several cases
  - Consequence of hypo: should focus on delaying aging, not curing diseases in aged body
