# Important concepts
- Async cryptography: signature (secret sign, public verify), decryption (public encrypt, secret decrypt)
- Public key as address
- Decentralization, validator nodes
- Hashing & chaining
- Token: fungible vs non-fungible (ownership, identity case), created by projects
- Smart contract: code uploaded to blockchain -> dApp
- Solana: efficiency, performance, cost, reliability issues, growth, SOL coin

# Solana APIs
- Connect to dev-test/main-beta cluster
- Address look up
- Get acc balance using public key
