## 7. Implementing queries in a microservice architecture
### Query using API composition pattern
- Design issues:
  - Decide which component to act as API composer:
    - Frontend client (eg web app): not practical for clients accessing services via the internet: slow network
    - API gateway/BFF variant -> allow clients accessing the gateway via the internet to efficiently retrieve the data
    - Standalone API composer: usage:
      - For queries used internally by multiple services
      - Externally accessible queries with logic too complex to be part of API gateway
  - Query performance: should call provider services in parallel
- Adv: simple to implement
- -> Should consider first when design queries
- Disadvs:
  - Costly query
  - Reduced availability: involve multiple services
  - -> Solution: see chap 3 - RPC design issues: recover from an unavailable service
  - Lack of transactional data consistency
### Query using CQRS pattern
- Usages:
  - When API composition can't efficiently perform a query:
  not all services store attributes that can be used to filter or sort:
    - <img src="./resources/7.7.png" width="500"/>
    - Solution:
      - API composer retrieve & join large data set -> inefficient
      - Fetch IDs, then bulk fetch other services -> require bulk fetch API
  - Service data model doesn't efficiently support the query (eg geospatial/text search query)
  - Need to separate concerns: service responsibility is maintaining business data, not querying data
- Architecture:
  - <img src="./resources/7.8.png" width="500"/>
  - <img src="./resources/7.10.png" width="500"/>
  - Command/domain model:
    - Handle CUD operations using its own database
    - Can handle simple queries (eg non-join, primary key-based query)
  - Query model: handle nontrivial queries
  - Can be applied within a service or can define query services:
  build DB by subscribing to events published by multiple services
- Advs:
  - Enable efficient queries
  - Enable efficient implementation of diverse queries using dif types of DB
  - Make querying possible in an event sourcing app
  - Improve separation of concerns: both command side & query side are simpler & easier to maintain
- Disadvs:
  - Complex architecture -> increased dev & operational effort
  - Replication lag -> client must handle inconsistency by:
    - Command side & query side APIs return version. When out of date, client poll the query side.
    - Update local model using data returned by the command
    - -> UI code might need to duplicate server side code
- Design issues:
  - Choose datastore tech for the view:
    - Considerations:
      - Characteristics of queries
      - How to efficiently implement update operations when receiving events
    - NoSQL advs: richer data mode, higher performance
    - SQL advs: familiar, BI, non-primary key-based update
  - Design data access module:
    - Handle concurrency: use lock or update DB records without reading them first
    - Handle duplicate event:
      - Idempotent
      - Record max event ID or map of (agg type-agg ID, max event ID)
    - Build & update CQRS view: use archived events. Use snapshot when don't have all events.
