## 14. Managing incidents
- Chars of unmanaged incidents:
  - Sharp focus on the technical problem:
  try to solve it, not think about the bigger picture of how to mitigate the problem
  - Poor communication: about what actions their colleagues are taking
  - Individual, uncoordinated work
- Features of well-designed incident management process:
  - Recursive separation of responsibilities: main roles:
    - Incident commander: command:
      - Hold the high-level state about the incident
      - Structure the incident response task force, assign responsibilities according to need and priority
      - Hold all positions that they have not delegated
      - Can remove roadblocks that prevent Ops from working most effectively
    - Ops team: operational work:
      - Ops lead works with the incident commander to respond to the incident by applying operational tools to the task at hand
      - Operations team should be the only group modifying the system during an incident
    - Communicator: communication:
      - Issue periodic updates to the incident response team and stakeholders (usually via email)
      - Other tasks: eg keep the incident document accurate & up to date
    - Planner: planning: support ops by dealing with longer-term issues (eg file bugs, order dinner, arrange handoffs,
    track how the system has diverged from the norm so that it can be reverted once the incident is resolved)
  - Recognized command post: offline room & online email/chat
  - Live incident state document:
    - Maintained by incident commander
    - Best practices:
      - Use a template to generate
      - Keep the most imp info at the top makes it more usable
      - Retain for postmortem analysis
  - Clear, live handoff of incident commander role
- When to declare an incident:
  - Declare early then find a simple fix
  - Set clear conditions for declaring an incident. Egs:
    - Do you need to involve a second team in fixing the problem?
    - Is the outage visible to customers?
    - Is the issue unsolved even after an hour's concentrated analysis?
