## 15. Postmortem culture: learning from failure
- Def: A written record of an incident, including:
  - Its impact
  - The actions taken to mitigate or resolve it
  - The root cause(s)
  - The follow-up actions to prevent the incident from recurring
- Goals:
  - Document the incident
  - Provide an understanding of the root causes
  - Put in place effective preventive actions to reduce the likelihood an/or impact of recurrence
- Examples of when to write:
  - User-visible downtime or degradation beyond a certain threshold
  - Data loss of any kind
  - On-call engineer intervention
  - A resolution time above some threshold
  - A monitoring failure (usually mean manual incident discovery)
  - Request from a stakeholder
- -> Make the criteria explicit
- Blameless culture: focus on identifying the contributing cases of the incident
without indicting any individual or team for bad or inappropriate behavior
- Best practices:
  - Collaborate and share knowledge:
    - Key features of tools to write postmortem:
      - Real-time collaboration
      - Open commenting/annotation system
      - Email notifications
    - Review criteria:
      - Was key incident data collected for posterity?
      - Are the impact assessments complete?
      - Was the root case sufficiently deep?
      - Is the action plan apt and are resulting bug fixes at apt priority?
      - Did we share the outcome with relevant stakeholders?
    - Process:
      - Write
      - Review
      - Share with larger team/mailing list
      - Store for ref
  - Introducing a postmortem culture:
    - Management encouragement & active participation
    - Social methods: postmortem of the month, reading clubs
    - Ask for feedback & improve the process
- Advanced tools:
  - Tools to integrate data into postmortem doc
