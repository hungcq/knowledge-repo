## 18. Software engineering in SRE
- Advs of SE within SRE:
  - Good understanding of production env & the tools needed
  - Dev for internal users
  - -> Quick & high quality feedback
  - Help SREs maintain coding skill & work balance
  - For the org: attract & help to retain engineers with a broad variety of skills
- Case study: automated capacity planning tool:
  - Problems, solution: skipped
  - Lesson learned:
    - Launch and iterate: can use prototype/non-optimal component at early stage
    - Set appropriate level of expectation about functionalities
    - Identify appropriate customers: those who can derive most benefits
    - Customer service: onboard users, address emotional concern
    - Design at the right level: general enough but don't have to cover every use cases (diminishing return)
- Considerations when choosing projects:
  - What makes a project a good candidate to take the leap from one-off tool to fully fledged software engineering effort:
    - Engineers with firsthand exp in the relative domain who are interested in working on the project
    - A target user base that is highly technical
    - -> Can provide high-signal bug reports during the early phases of development
    - Project with noticeable benefits (eg reducing toil for SREs, improving existing piece of infra, streamlining a complex process)
    - Project fits into the overall set of objectives for the org
    - -> Engineering leaders can weigh its potential impact & subsequently advocate for the project
  - Red flags:
    - Software that touches many moving parts at once
    - Software design that requires an all or nothing approach that prevents iterative development
    - Overly specific work that only benefits a small percentage of the org
    - Tools too flexible & universal
    - -> Risk not quite fitting any use case
- Build SE culture:
  - Team components: SREs with strong coding and software development skills,
  but may not have the traditional software development experience of being part of a product team
  or having to think about customer feature requests
  - -> Partner with engineers, TPMs or PMs who are familiar with user-facing software development
  - Allocate dedicated, non-interrupted, project work time
  - SREs involved in any dev effort continue working as SREs instead of becoming full-time devs
  - -> Maintain production env perspective
  - How to introduce a software development model to an SRE org focused on production support:
    - Recognize that this goal is as much an org change as it is a technical challenge
    - Think about the goal of developing software in SRE:
      - Foster better software development practices within the team
      - Software development that produces results that can be used across teams, possibly as a standard for the org
      - -> Need to:
        - Create & communicate a clear message about strategy, plans, and **the benefits SRE gains from this effort**
        - Evaluate the org's capabilities to build & ship a product
        - -> Educate/recruit if necessary
        - Launch and iterate: aim for relatively straightforward & achievable targets
        - Don't lower your standard
