- Lessons learned:
  - First of all, don't panic
  - If you feel overwhelmed, pull in more people
  - If the company has an incident response process, remember & follow it
  - Backup access & communication channel
  - The highest priority is to resolve the issue at hand quickly
  - Ask the big, even improbable questions: what if...?
  - Encourage proactive testing (controlled failure)
