## 9. Simplicity
- System stability vs agility tradeoff
- Make code predictable. Prevent & reduce accidental complexity.
- Delete dead code
- Minimal APIs
- Modularity: service decomposition & separating config
- Release simplicity: small batch -> easy to understand the change
- Conclusion: simplicity is prerequisite to reliability
