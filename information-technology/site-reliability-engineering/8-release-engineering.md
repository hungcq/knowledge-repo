## 8. Release engineering
- Role & def:
  - Focus: building & delivering software
  - Role: work with software engineers in product development & SREs to define all the steps required to release software:
    - Source code management
    - Build rules for compilation
    - Testing, packaging, deployment
- Best practices:
  - Self-service model:
  develop best practices & tools to allow product development teams to control & run their own release processes
  - Release frequently
  - Hermetic builds
  - -> Ensure consistency & repeatability
  - Enforcement of policies & procedures
- Google processes & best practices for continuous build & continuous delivery
- 4 dif approaches to config management
- Recommendations:
  - Define release processes for common release problems
  - Start release engineering at the beginning
  - -> Cheaper to put good practices & process in place early
