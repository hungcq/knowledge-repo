## 17. Testing for reliability
- Types of tests:
  - Traditional tests:
    - More common in software development to evaluate the correctness of software offline, during development
    - Types:
      - Unit tests
      - Integration tests
      - System tests:
        - Smoke tests: test very simple but critical behavior
        - -> Simplest type
        - Performance tests
        - Regression tests: prevent introducing old bugs
  - Production tests:
    - Def: interact with a live production system
    - -> Similar to blackbox monitoring
    - Types:
      - Configuration test:
        - Test which version of config the binary is using
        - Simple case: query the service to retrieve config content, compare with the goal file content
      - Stress test: goal: find the limits on a web service
      - Canary test: for new version of service/config
- Testing at scale:
  - Test the env (eg runtime lib)
  - Test SRE tools
  - Test whether internal state seen through the API is constant across the operation
