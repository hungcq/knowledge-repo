## 12. Effective troubleshooting
- Triage def: find out how serious the situation is
- <img src="./resources/12-1.png" width="500">
- Principle: hypothetico-deductive method: iteratively test hypothetical causes of the failure:
  - Form hypotheses using:
    - Observations of the system
    - Theoretical basis for understanding system behavior
  - 2 approaches to test hypotheses:
    - Compare the observed state of the system against our theories to find confirming or disconfirming evidence
    - Change the system in a controlled way and observe the results
- Common pitfalls:
  - (1)Look at symptoms that aren't relevant or misunderstand the meaning of system metrics
  - (2) Misunderstand how to change the system, its inputs/envs to safely and effectively test hypotheses
  - (1) & (2) -> Require general distributed system knowledge & knowledge of this particular system
  - Come up with wildly improbable theories about what's wrong, or latching on to causes of past problems
  - -> Require common sense: think about probable causes first
  - Spurious correlation: due to large amount of data or mistaking correlation with causation
- Best practices:
  - Problem report:
    - Chars of effective report:
      - Expected behavior
      - Actual behavior
      - Optional:
        - How to reproduce the behavior
        - Reports have a consistent form and stored in a searchable location
      - -> Jira
    - Avoid direct messaging: less visibility, more workload to popular team member
  - Triage:
    - Assess the severity:
      - Low impact problems
      - High impact problems: emergency call/meeting
    - Deal with major outage:
      - Don't start troubleshooting and try to find a root cause as quickly as possible
      - Make the system work as well as it can under the circumstances
      - -> Can take steps to preserve evidence of what's going wrong (eg logs) to help with subsequent root-cause analysis
