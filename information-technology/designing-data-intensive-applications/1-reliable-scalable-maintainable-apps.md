# I.	Foundations of data systems
## 1. Reliable, scalable & maintainable applications
- Functions of data-intensive app:
  - Store data: DB
  - Remember search operation, speed up read: cache
  - Search by key word: search index
  - Send mes to other processes: stream processing
  - Crunch large volume of data: batch processing
- 3 non-functional concerns:
  - Reliability: work correctly, even when faults occur (fault-tolerant). Handle certain types of faults:
    - Hardware
    - Software
    - Human
  - Scalability: maintain performance when load increases:
    - Load: load params:
      - Request/s
      - Read/write DB
      - CCU
      - Cache hit rate
    - Performance:
      - Throughput
      - Response time: distribution of value (eg 99.9 percentile histogram)
      - Maintain performance: scale up vs scale out
  - Maintainability: let people work productively on the system
    - Operability
    - Simplicity:
      - Good abstraction (eg APIs)
      - Avoid accidental complexity
    - Evolvability:
      - Simplicity
      - TTD, refactoring
