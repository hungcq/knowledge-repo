# White paper
## Well Architected Framework
- Stop guessing capacity needs -> use ASG
- Test systems at production scale
- Automate to make architectural experimentation easier
- Allow for evolutionary architectures
- Drive architectures using data
- Improve through game days (eg flash sale simulation)
- 6 pillars:
  - Operational excellence
  - Security
  - Reliability
  - Performance efficiency
  - Cost optimization
  - Sustainability
- -> Not sth to balance/tradeoff, but a synergy
- Well architected tool: free tool to review architectures against the 6 pillars & adopt architectural best practices
