# III - Refactoring toward deeper insight
- Structure:
  - Clarify goal of developing a domain model that captures a deep understanding of the domain
  - Describe model development process
  - Explain design principles & patterns to make the design accommodate the needs of the app as well as the devs themselves
- 3 levels of refactoring that should happen continuously:
  - Detailed, code level: mainly for readability
  - Design pattern level
  - Domain level: motivated by new insights into the domain or those that clarify the model's expression through code
  - -> Greatest impact on the viability of the system
- Deep model:
  - Provide a lucid expression of the primary concerns of the domain experts and their most relevant knowledge
  - Remove the superficial aspects of the domain
  - Can have both abstract & concrete elements
- Outline:
  - Chap 8: story of a breakthrough
  - Chap 10:
    - How to make a design easy to change and integrate
    - How to write flexible, extensible software
  - Chap 9: find & integrate domain concept into the design
  - Chap 11: analysis patterns application
  - Chap 12: design patterns application

## 8. Breakthrough
- Chars:
  - High oppo from a deeper model
  - Require major change in design & code refactoring
  - -> High risk
- Don't look for a breakthrough: focus on refining the model & design via knowledge crunching, ubi lang
