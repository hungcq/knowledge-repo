# I - Putting the domain model to work
- Model def
- Domain def
- Domain model def
- To be useful, software must be involved in users' activities
- -> Domain knowledge is required
- -> Models to deal with the complexity & to focus on the problem
- Domain modeling def
- Goals & advs of DDD:
  - The model and the heart of the design shape each other:
  close rela between the model & impl
  - The model is the backbone of a language used by all team members, including domain experts
  - The model is distilled knowledge:
  the team's agreed-upon way of structuring domain knowledge & distinguishing the elements of most interest
- The heart of software is its ability to solve domain-related problems for its user
- -> Must focus on the domain, not technology
- Domain modeling as a technical challenge: handling complexity

## 1. Crunching knowledge
- Modeling principles:
  - Focus: understand the imp principles of the business, not producing function mechanically
  - Modeling: go beyond finding the nouns
  - -> Need to model business activities and rules
  - There may be actual inconsistency among business rules
  - -> Need clarification & reconciliation
  - Make business rule explicit as a policy
  - -> Advs:
    - Devs & stakeholders understand the business rule
    - Technical artifact/code is understandable even to the domain experts
- Evolution of models with growing knowledge

### Addi
- Grow knowledge as a dev:
  - Technical
  - General domain modeling skills
  - Domain knowledge
