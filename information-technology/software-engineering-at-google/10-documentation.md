## 10. *Documentation*
### Overview
- SEs write most of the doc themselves
- -> Need proper processes, tools & incentives
- Advs:
  - Understandable code & APIs
  - Clearly stated design goals & team objectives -> project team are more focused
  - Clear steps for manual processes
  - Less effort to onboard new members to a team/code base
  - Long term benefit to all future readers
- Reasons why doc is not popular:
  - No immediate benefit to writers
  - Engineers' attitude:
    - View writing as a separate skill than that of programming
    - Don't feel like they are capable writers
  - Limited tools & integration into dev workflow
  - Doc is view as extra burden to be maintained
- Good doc: 
  - 3 aspects: completeness, accuracy, clarity
  - -> Usually there are tradeoffs between those
  - Good doc does it intended job of its type
### Best practices
- Treat as code:
  - With owner/maintainer
  - With internal policies/standard rules to optimized for readers
  - Version controlled
  - Review changes
  - Track issues
  - Evaluated periodically
  - With tools to measure accuracy, freshness...
- Write for audience:
  - Identify the audience formally/informally before writing
  - Criteria to categorize audience:
    - Experience level (eg expert or junior)
    - Domain knowledge (eg team member or outsider)
    - Purpose (eg quick reference or checking implementation details)
    - How a user encounters the doc:
      - Seekers knowing what they want: focus on consistency in style to support efficient search
      - Stumblers not knowing exactly what they want: provide overview/intro & intended audience
    - Customer vs provider (implementor): create separate doc for each type
  - -> Write the doc at their level
  - How to approach a broad audience: keep the doc short: might require maintaining a larger, detailed one
- Know the dif types, not mix types
- Doc reviews: 3 types of reviews (can sometimes be mixed):
  - Technical review:
    - Goal: accuracy
    - Reviewer: subject matter expert
  - Audience review:
    - Goal: clarity
    - Reviewer: someone unfamiliar with the domain
  - Writing review:
    - Goal: consistency
    - Reviewer: technical writer/volunteer
- Doc usually answer How question. Try to address who-what-when-where-why in the first 2 paragraphs of any doc:
  - Who: audience
  - What: purpose of the doc
  - -> The doc should contain only info related to the what
  - When: when the doc was created, reviewed or updated (explicitly or implicitly using tools)
  - Where: where the doc should live, often implicit
  - Why: summary of what you expect someone to take away from the doc
- Structure: should have beginning, middle & end:
  - Beginning: problem
  - Middle: recommended solution
  - End: takeaways
- Deprecation:
  - Should avoid abandoned docs as much as possible
  - Deprecation steps:
    - Remove or mark it as obsolete
    - Indicate where to go for new info (if possible)
- Technical writer: focus on writing docs that cross API boundaries
### Doc types
- Reference doc (most common type):
  - Usually generated from code comments
  - 2 types by purpose:
    - API comments
    - Implementation comments
  - 3 types by place:
    - File comments:
      - Should be used for all files
      - Content:
        - Main use cases
        - Intended audience
    - Class comments: content:
      - Purpose of the class
      - Important methods
    - Function/public method comments:
      - Use indicative verb
      - Content:
        - What the function does
        - What is returned
- Design doc:
  - Best practices:
    - Require approved design doc before starting working on any major project
    - Use design doc template approved by the team
    - Should support collaboration
  - Content:
    - Goals of the design
    - Implementation strategy
    - Key design decisions with emphasis on their individual tradeoffs
- Tutorial:
  - When to write: when you first join a team
  - Content: everything needs to be done along the way
  - Number the steps explicitly
  - Types:
    - Focus on user:
      - Number each action that a user, not the system, needs to undertake
      - Denote user-visible input or output on separate lines
    - Focus on other aspect: number the steps from the perspective of that focus
- Conceptual doc:
  - Purposes:
    - Provide overviews of the APIs/systems
    - To augment, not replace a reference document set
  - Tradeoffs: duplication, simplification
  - Difficult to write -> unpopular
- Landing pages:
  - Content: only links to other pages for more info
  - Audience: user of your product or API
### Additional info
- Canonical doc to avoid conflicts of docs with dif owners
