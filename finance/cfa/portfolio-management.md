# Portfolio management
## Portfolio risk & return
- According to CAPM, rational investor will choose portfolio along the CAL
- Diversification ratio = portfolio return std / avg std of individual securities in the portfolio
- -> Lower = better diversification
## Risk management
- Risk exposure should be measured after risk budgeting\
## Concepts
- Portfolio management process:
  - Planning: determine client needs & circumstances (IPS)
  - Execution: construct portfolio based on IPS:
    - Top-down analysis: allocate to asset classes
    - Bottom-up analysis: choose securities for each classes
  - Feedback:
    - Monitor & re-balance in response to market performance
    - Measure & report performance
- Market share: active management > passive. Passive is increasing.
- Separately managed account: portfolio management for rich investors: annual fee, advice
- Pooled investment: single portfolio containing investments from multiple investors (eg funds)
- No-load fund: no fee for purchase/redeem shares
- Net asset value (NAV): pool asset value / num shares issued
- Multi boutique firm: have dif specialist asset managers (multi style/class)
- Gross return: total return after trade commission & costs, but before management/administration of acc
- -> Net return
- Pretax/after tax return
- Real return: adjusted for inflation
- Money-weighted:
  - Affected more by adding fund before period of low/high performance
  - Suitable when manager control in/out flow
- Time-weighted: preferred
- Minimum variance frontier: combined by ports that have the lowest variance for a given level of return
- -> Global min var portfolio
- Efficient frontier: highest return ports for each level of risk (top portion of min var frontier)
- CAL: risk-free asset + risky asset. Show return per total risk (std).
- CML: risk-free asset + market portfolio. Show return per total risk (std).
- SML (CAPM): return vs beta for any security
- Security characteristic line: regression line of market excess return from dif assets' excess returns
- Return generator model: equation that estimates expected return of an investment,
based on a security of exposure to macro/fundamental/statistical factors
- -> Multi-factor model: macro & fundamental
- -> Market model
- CAPM assumptions:
  - Investors: risk averse, utility maximizing, rational, same time period, same expectation of return
  - Market: no costs & no taxes
  - Investment: infinitely divisible
  - Prices: not affected by trade
- Attribution analysis: analysis of the sources of return difference between active portfolio return & passive benchmark port
- IPS sections:
  - Procedures: to update IPS in response to unforeseen events
  - Investment objective: client needs: required return  & risk tolerance
  - Investment constraints: factors that might hinder ability to meet investment objectives:
  time horizon, liquidity, legal, tax, unique needs
  - Investment guideline: allowed types of assets
  - Appendices: strategic asset allocation/rebalancing policy
- Relative/abs risk/return objective
- Strategic vs tactical asset allocation
- Cognitive error: info processing:
  - Belief preservation
  - Processing
- Emotional biases: more spontaneous, related to emotions
- Risk gov: senior management determination of org's risk tolerance, risk exposure strat & risk management framework
- Risk budgeting: allocate total risk to assets/investments
- Financial risks: credit, liquidity, market
- Non-financial risks: related to operations
- Approach to risks: self-insurance, transfer risk (insurance), shift risk (eg use derivatives)
- delta, gamma, vega, rho (derivative risk): price, change in price, volatility, change in risk-free rate
- Candlestick chart: white box (vs black box): closing price > opening price
