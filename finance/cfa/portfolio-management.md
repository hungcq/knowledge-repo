## Portfolio risk & return
- The security market line (SML) is a graphical representation of the capital asset pricing model,
with beta risk on the x-axis and expected return on the y-axis.
- Capital market line: combination of market portfolio with risk-free asset
- Capital allocation line: combination of any risky asset with risk-free asset
- Treynor ratio: portfolio excess return per unit of systematic risk: (Rp - Rf) / beta(p)
- Jensen's alpha: difference between a portfolio return and the return of a portfolio on the SML that has the same beta:
  - alpha = Rp - (Rf + beta * (Rm - Rf))
## Risk management
- Risk exposure should be measured after risk budgeting
