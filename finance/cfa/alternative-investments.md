## Concept answers
- Traditional investment: long-only investment in cash or publicly traded stocks/bonds
- -> Alternative investment: other types of investments
- Adverse selection (co-investing): fund managers select better assets for the fund, offer co-investors worse assets
- Dry powder: committed capital not invested (drawn down)
- Alternative investment general structure: limited partnership: GP (fund manager), LPs (investors)
- Management fee:
  - Hedge fund: % of net asset value
  - Private equity fund: % of committed capital (> capital invested)
- Catch up clause: ~ soft hurdle
- Waterfall: way in which payments are allocated to GP & LPs as profits & losses are realized on deals (each fund managed)
- Deal-by-deal waterfall (American) vs whole of fund (European)
- Clawback provision: LP can recover previous incentive payment on gains that are later reversed
- High watermark: provision that no incentive fees are paid on gains that only offset prior losses
- -> Incentive fee only when account value is higher than the highest previous value
- Sortino ratio: (return - Rf) / downside deviation
- Calmar ratio: avg annual compound return (usually 3 years) / max draw down (peak - trough value)
- -> Higher, better
- Return measures:
  - Multiple of invested capital (money multiplier):
    (total capital returned + value of remaining asset) / total capital paid in
  - IRR: more accurate
- Either or fee: pay max (management fee, incentive fee)
- Founder's share: benefits to early investors of a fund
- Private debt: lending to private entities
- Private equity investments:
  - Private companies
  - Public companies to take private (leveraged buyout - use debt as leverage)
  - Early stage companies (venture capital fund)
  - Distressed investment
  - Developmental capital (minority equity investing): provide capital for business growth/restructuring.
  Private investment in public equity: dev capital in public companies
- Venture capital investment stages:
  - Formative:
    - Angel (pre-seed): idea stage
    - Seed (most popular): fund product dev, marketing, market research
    - Early (start-up): fund initial commercial production
  - Later stage (expansion): fund expansion for companies which already have production & sales
  - Mezzanie stage: fund to prepare for an IPO
- Exit strats for private equity fund:
  - Trade sale: sell company to competitor company/strategic buyer
  - IPO
  - Recapitalization: issue debt to pay dividend (only a step toward exit)
  - Secondary sale: sell to another private equity firm or a group of investors
  - Write off/liquidation
- Types of private debts:
  - Direct lending. Leveraged loan: borrow from another source.
  - Venture debt
  - Mezzanine loan (subordinated debt)
  - Distressed debt: buy debt of firms at or near bankruptcy
  - -> Active engagement in restructuring
- Indexes of real estate performance:
  - Appraisal index: based on periodic estimate of property values
  - -> Smoother, low std
  - Repeat sale index: based on price changes for properties sold multiple time
  - -> Sample may not be representative
  - REIT: based on REIT share price
- Brownfield investment chars (vs greenfield): stable cash flow, high yield, low growth potential
- Contango (future price > current price) vs backwardation
- Lock up period: time after initial investment over which LP cannot/costly redemption
- Notice period (30-90 days): time for the fund to fulfill a redemption request
- Backfill bias (hedge fund performance): effect on historical index returns of adding a new fund to an index
- Hedge fund strategies:
  - Event-driven: based on corp restructuring or acquisition
    that creates profit opportunities for long/short position in securities of a specific corp (eg merger, restructuring)
  - Relative value: buy a security & sell short another related security 
  - -> Profit when a perceived pricing discrepancy between the 2 is resolved (eg fixed income, option volatility)
  - Macro (top down):
    - Based on global economic trends & events
    - Involve long/short positions in securities, currencies & commodities
  - Equity (bottom up): long/short positions in publicly traded equities & equity derivatives
    (eg fundamental growth/value, sector specific, market neutral (equal amount in long & short position) vs short bias)
- MBS is alter investment in real estate
- Derivatives are alternative investment
