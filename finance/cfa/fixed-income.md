# Fixed income
- Plain vanilla bond: standard coupon bond
- Original discount tax provision:
    - Requires the investor to include a prorated portion of the original issue discount
      in his taxable income every tax year until maturity
    - When the bond matures, the investor faces no capital gain or loss
- Shelf-registration: allows certain authorized issuers to offer additional bonds to the general public
  without having to prepare a new and separate offering circular
- Term maturity structure: bonds from a single issue that all mature on the same date
- Discount margin = YTM - reference rate
- Rates if not mentioned period, are always quoted on 1-year basis
- Review example of estimating YTM of illiquid bond
- Investment grade: from BBB to AAA (BB or B is not)
- Capital gain/loss on selling bond = sell price - NPV
## ABS
- Call protection: prepayment protection
- Balloon risk: risk that the borrower will not be able to the balloon payment
- -> ~ extension risk
- Parties involved in securitization:
  - Seller/depositor
  - SPE/issuer
  - Servicer
## Risk & return
- Modified duration calculation: (V+ - V-) / (2V0 * delta YTM)
- Convexity calculation: (V+ + V- - 2V0) / (V0 * delta YTM)
- Change in bond price calculation, using modified duration & convexity:
-duration * delta YTM + 1/2 * convexity * delta YTM ^ 2
- Calculate money duration: use full price of bond
- Yield curve for option-free, callable, putable bond -> convexity
## Credit analysis
- Analyze:
  - High quality debt: focus more on default & spread risk
  - Low quality debt: focus more on loss severity & liquidity risk
- Credit rating focus primarily on probability of default. Loss severity & liquidity are secondary, used for notching.
- EBITDA = operating profit + depreciation & amortization
