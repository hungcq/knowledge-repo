- Financial leverage = EBIT/EBT -> more debt = higher leverage
- Operating leverage = revenue/EBIT -> lower profit = higher leverage

## Capital investment
- Discount rate (in NPV calculation) = opportunity cost of capital (COC)
- Capital budgeting analysis usually applies to replacement/mandatory project, not research & development project (high risk)
- Research & development cost is sunk cost, should not be included in calculating project's cash flow
- Break points in the marginal cost of capital structure occur at the levels where the cost of one of the components
of the company's capital structure increases, increasing its weighted average cost of capital
