# Corporate issuers
- Financial leverage = EBIT/EBT -> more debt = higher leverage
- Operating leverage = revenue/EBIT -> lower profit = higher leverage
- Common law = US law = more protection to shareholder
- Estimation of WACC: always use target capital structure if available.
Only use market value to estimate when target structure not available.
## Capital investment
- Discount rate (in NPV calculation) = opportunity cost of capital (COC)
- Capital budgeting analysis usually applies to replacement/mandatory project, not research & development project (high risk)
- Research & development cost is sunk cost, should not be included in calculating project's cash flow
- Capital component break point = value at which component's cost of capital changes / component weight in WACC
## Corporate governance
- Nomination committee:
  - Asset board members' performance
  - Nominate board members
