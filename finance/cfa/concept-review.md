  - Sum of values of all FRA = 0 at initiation
  - Valuation: MRR1 / (1 + S1) + MRR2 / (1 + S2) ^ 2 + ... = F / (1 + S1) + F / (1 + S2) ^ 2 + ...
  - -> Calculate expected forward rates (MRRs) using spot rate (S), then solve for F

# Alternative investments
- Hedge fund strategies:
  - Event-driven: based on corp restructuring or acquisition
  that creates profit opportunities for long/short position in securities of a specific corp (eg merger, restructuring)
  - Relative value: buy a security & sell short another related security
  with goal of profiting when a perceived pricing discrepancy between the 2 is resolved (eg fixed income, option volatility)
  - Macro: based on global economic trends & events, involve long/short positions in securities, currencies & commodities
  - Equity: long/short positions in publicly traded equities & equity derivatives
  (eg fundamental growth/value, sector specific, market neutral (equal amount in long & short position) vs short bias)
