# Economics

## Demand & supply analysis
- Normal profit is the level of accounting profit such that implicit opportunity costs are just covered
- -> = 0 economic profit
- Giffen good: inferior good with income effect > substitution effect
- -> Increase in price increase quantity demanded
- Veblen goods: highly valued, high-priced "status" goods
- -> Consumers may tend to buy more if its price rises
- Slope of demand curve is slope of function of price in terms of demand (b) : P = a - b.Q
- -> Demand curve: P is y-axis, Q is x-axis -> present P in terms of Q

## Business structure
- Collusion is less likely when companies have similar market shares -> higher competitive force
- Dif degree of price discrimination for monopoly:
  - First degree: a monopolist can charge each customer the highest price the customer is willing to pay
  - -> Capture all consumer surplus
  - Second degree: monopolist offers a menu of quantity-based pricing options designed to
    induce customers to self-select based on how highly they value the product (eg volume discount, bundling)
  - Third degree: customers are segregated by demographic or other traits

## Aggregate output, prices, and economic growth
- GPD by consumption = C + G + I + (X - M)
- C + S + T (national income) = C + G + I + (X - M)
- -> (X - M) = (S - I) + (T - G)
- GDP inclusion criteria:
    - Within the period
    - Has market value. Exception: owner-occupied housing & gov services.
    - Final good, not intermediate
- GPD as income/output:
    - <img src="resources/gdp.png" width="500">
- GPD calculation:
  - Expenditure approach: add statistical discrepancy
  - Income approach: add capital consumption allowance
- Mixed income = income from unincorporated business (eg farm, rental)
- Increase in expected income -> decrease saving -> decrease supply of financial capital -> increase interest rate

## Business cycles
- Cycle: recovery -> expansion (peak) -> slowdown -> contraction (bottom/trough)
- Draw a 4-column table for the 4 phases:
    - <img src="resources/cycle-employment.png" width="600">
    - <img src="resources/cycle-inventory.png" width="600">
- Credit cycles tend to be  longer, deeper, and sharper than business cycles
- Fiscal policy is the use of taxes and government spending to affect the level of aggregate expenditures
- Monetary policy:
  - Def 1: action taken by a nation's central bank to affect aggregate output and prices
    through changes in bank reserves, reserve requirements, or its target interest rate
  - Def 2: central bank activities that are directed toward influencing the quantity of money and credit in an economy

## Geopolitics
- Tools of geopolitics:

## Balance of payments
- Foreign direct investment increases capital account surplus -> increase current account deficit

## Currency exchange rate
- Appreciation to be affective to reduce trade surplus -> decrease in capital account deficit
- (export = + current acc, buy capital abroad = -capital acc) -> export decrease = buy less capital abroad
- -> Domestic sell more capital to foreign/foreign sell less capital to domestic
- Quote: price/base currency
- Direct & indirect quote:
  - Direct quote: domestic/foreign
  - Indirect quote: foreign/domestic
- Forward premium/discount is relative to the base currency (B in A/B quote). Quote by:
  - Point: add/subtract directly
  - Percent: multiply

## Concept answers
- 211: income effect
- 212: long run average total cost curve
- 249: national income, personal income
- 260:
  - Inflationary gap
  - Recessionary gap
  - Stagflation
- 280: credit cycle: cyclical fluctuation of interest rate & credit availability
- 281: neoclassical/Keynesian/monetarist/Austrian economics & business cycle & suggested actions:
  - Neoclassical:
    - Cycle driven by technological change
    - Non interventionism approach: wage & input price will adjust rapidly
  - New classical (real business cycle theory):
    - Cycle due to utility maximizing actors responding to real economic forces (external shock, change in technology)
    - Non interventionism approach
  - Keynesian:
    - Cycle due to excessive optimism/pessimism by managers, contractions can persist due to slow adjustment of wage/input price
    - Intervention by fiscal policy
  - Monetarist:
    - Cycle due to inapt money supply
    - Approach: maintain moderate & predictable money supply growth
  - Austrian:
    - Cycle due to gov intervention that drives interest rate to low level
    - Non interventionism approach
- 270:

- 332:
  - Trade restriction:
    - Minimum domestic content: requirement that some % of product content must be from domestic country
