# Equity
- Fama & French 3 factors model: relative size, relative book-to-market value, and beta of the asset
- Warrant holders have the right to buy the issuer's common stock

## Market structure
- Bid = dealer buy in = lower price
- Offer = dealer sell out = higher price
- 3 main functions of financial system:
  - Enable save, borrow, raising capital, manage risk, exchange asset, utilize info
  - Determine rate of return where saving = borrowing
  - Allocate capital efficiently
- Broker: help clients buy & sell securities by finding counterparties to trade in a cost-efficient manner.
Block broker: help with large trade.
- -> Vs dealer: buy and sell from their own inventory. Primary dealer: trade securities with central banks
- Alternative trading systems (ATS/electronic communication networks): ~exchange but have no regulatory function.
Dark pool: ATS that do not reveal client orders.
- Depository institutions (eg bank, credit union)
- Custodian: hold client securities & prevent loss due to fraud/other events
- Short-selling chars:
  - Payment-in-lieu: short seller must pay all dividends or interest that the lender would have received from the loaned securities
  - Deposit proceeds of the short sale as collateral to guarantee eventual repurchase
  - -> Interest in the fund earned by broker. Might return a portion to the short seller (short rebate rate).
- Call money rate: interest rate of margin loan on a leveraged position. > gov bill rate.
- Instructions:
  - Execution: how to trade:
    - Market order: execute immediately at the best possible price
    - Limit order: specify min price to buy, max price to sell. Types:
      - Marketable/aggressively priced: buy above the best ask, sell below the best bid
      - -> Part of the order is likely to execute immediately
      - Making a new market/inside the market: price between the best bid & best ask
      - Behind the market (far from the market): buy limit price below the best bid/sell limit price above the best ask
      - -> Won't be executed until securities prices move toward the limit price
    - All-or-nothing
    - Hidden order: only broker/exchange know the trade size
    - Iceberg order: with specified size displayed, the rest hidden
  - Validity: when to execute the trade:
    - Day order: expire if unfulfilled by the end of trading day

- Call market: stock is only traded at specific times
- -> Vs continuous market: stock is traded any time the market is open
- Market structures:
  - Quote-driven/dealers/price-driven/over-the-counter market: transact with dealers
  - Order-driven (eg exchange, automated trading system):
    - Chars: orders executed using trading rules. Traders are anonymous.
    - Order matching rules: order precedence hierarchy:
      - Price
      - Non hidden
      - Arrival time
      - Trade pricing rules: price determination:
        - Uniform pricing: all orders trade at the same price that results in the highest volume of trading
        - Discriminatory pricing: use limit price of the order that arrives earliest
        - Derivative pricing (in crossing network): derive from the main market price
  - Brokered market: broker find counterparty to trade
- Market info: pre-trade transparent (vs post-trade transparent): investors can obtain pre-trade info regarding quotes & orders
- -> Better for buyers (vs better for dealers)

  - Complete: fulfill all intended functions: save, borrow, hedge risk, trade all types of assets
  - Operationally efficient: low trading cost
  - Informationally efficient: security prices reflect all info

## Security indexes
- Price return vs total return
- Value weighted index = market capitalization weighted index
- Use of market indexes:
  - Reflection of market sentiment
  - Benchmark of manager performance
  - Measure of market return and risk
  - Proxy to measure beta (systematic risk)
  - Model portfolio for index funds
- Reconstitution (vs rebalancing): change securities that are included in an index
- Style index: measure return to market capitalization and value or growth strategies (eg small-cap value fund)
- Market float: reflect shares available to investing public.
Free float: market float exclude shares not available to foreign buyers.
- Fundamental weighting index: use weight based on firm fundamentals (eg earning, dividends, cash flow)
- -> Unaffected by share price of index stock
- -> Adv: avoid over-value tilt. Disadv: have value tilt.

## Market efficiency
- Efficient market -> market value always = intrinsic value
- Event study: test semi-strong form EMH by examining abnormal returns before & after the release of new info
that affects a firm intrinsic value
- Anomalies:
  - Time-series:
    - Calendar (eg January effect)
    - Overreaction: reversing performance trend
    - Momentum: continuing performance trend
  - Cross-sectional:
    - Size effect: small-cap outperform large-cap stock
    - Value effect: value stock outperform growth stock
  - Others
- Information cascade: when investors mimic decisions of others

## Equity securities
- Type of preferred stocks:
  - Cumulative: missed dividends must be paid before common shareholders receive any dividends
  - Participating
  - Convertible
- Risk of stock: lowest to highest: cumulative, preferred, putable common, common, callable common
- Sponsored/unsponsored depository receipt:
  - Sponsored: ~ common share: owner has the voting right
  - Unsponsored: depository bank retains the voting right
- Baskets of listed depository receipts: ETF that invest in depository receipts

## Industry & company analysis
- Companies by industries: (in book)
- Gov classification system: less fine-grained, updated less frequently
- Strategic analysis of an industry: analyze competitive forces that determine the possibility of economic profits
- Industry/sector rotation strategy: time investment in industries
through an analysis of fundamentals and/or business-cycle conditions
- High pricing power cases:
  - High barrier to entry (except when high barrier to exit & overcapacity)
  - High industry concentration
  - Differentiated products
  - Under capacity
  - Stable market share
  - High switching cost: cost customer faced when switching products
- Phases of industry life cycle:
  - Embryonic: slow growth, **high price**, **high risk**
  - Growth: **rapid growth**, **little competition**, falling price, increasing profit
  - Shakeout: slowing growth, **high competition**, overcapacity, declining profit, increasing failure
  - Mature: slow growth, consolidation, **high barriers to entry**, stable price, **stable market share**
  - Decline: **negative growth**, consolidation, declining price
- Analysis: industry then company
- Predatory pricing: aggressive cost cutting to drive out competitors

## Equity valuation
- Valuation models:
  - Discounted cash flow: Gordon growth, FCFE
  - Multipliers: P/E, P/S, P/B, EV/EBITDA
  - Asset-based
- P/E ratio based on the Gordon growth dividend discount model = D1/E1 / (râˆ’g) = dividend payout ratio / (r-g)
- Free cash flow to equity model:
  - Present model, used to measure firm's capacity to pay dividends
  - Used for firms that currently don't pay dividends
