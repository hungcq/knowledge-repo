# Fixed income
- Rates if not mentioned period, are always quoted on 1-year basis
- Capital gain/loss on selling bond = sell price - NPV

## Risk & return
- Calculate money duration: use full price of bond
- Yield curve for option-free, callable, putable bond -> convexity

## Credit analysis
- Analyze:
  - High quality debt: focus more on default & spread risk
  - Low quality debt: focus more on loss severity & liquidity risk
- Credit rating focus primarily on probability of default. Loss severity & liquidity are secondary, used for notching.

## Concept answers
- Tenor: time left until maturity
- Plain vanilla bond: standard coupon bond
- Original discount tax provision:
  - Requires the investor to include a prorated portion of the original issue discount
    in his taxable income every tax year until maturity
  - When the bond matures, the investor faces no capital gain or loss
- 25: bond indenture/trust deed
- 26:
  - Foreign bond/Eurobond market/currency
  - Secured/unsecured bond
  - Credit enhancements:
    - Internal:
      - Over-collateralization
      - Excess spread
      - Tranches
    - External:
      - Surety bond: insured by insurance company
      - Bank guarantee: insured by bank
      - Letter of credit: promise by bank to lend if needed
  - Tax treatment:
    - Interest income & pure discount bond increase: use ordinary income tax rate

  - Cash flow:
    - Bullet (repay entire principal at maturity)/fully amortizing/partially amortizing
    - Sinking fund provision: require issuer to retire a portion of a bond issue at specified times during the bond's life
    - 20-21:
      - Step up coupon note: coupon rate increase over time on predetermined schedule
      - Credit-linked: coupon rate linked reversely to rating of issuer
      - Payment-in-kind: allow issuer to make coupon payments by increasing principal amount of the outstanding bonds
      - -> Higher yield. Used when not enough cash to pay coupon.
      - Deferred coupon: regular coupon/principal payments only begin after a period of time since issuance
      - Index-linked: coupon based on an index (eg equity, commodity, inflation (ie linkers)).
        Principal protected bond: index-linked bond that will not pay less than original par value at maturity
- Investment grade: AAA, AA, A, BBB (or Aaa -> Baa3)
- 30:
  - Grey market
  - Syndicate
  - Shelf-registration:

      without having to prepare a new and separate offering circular
- 38:
  - Auction of bond: usually for gov bond
  - Private placement: sale of an entire issue to a qualified investor/group of investors (typically large institutions)
- 31: tender offer: secondary market transaction: issuer offers to repurchase some of its outstanding bonds at a specified price

  - Non-sovereign gov bond, agency (quasi) gov bond
  - Bank debt: bilateral loan, syndicated loan
  - Commercial paper: money market instrument issued by corps of high credit quality
  - Term maturity (corp bonds)
  - Serial maturity structure (corp bonds): mature on a predetermined schedule
  - Medium-term note: corp issues that can be structured to meet the requirements of investors
  - Credit-linked note: yield enhancement instrument (higher yield):
    redeemed at less than par value if a specified credit event occurs on a reference asset
  - Capital-protected (guaranteed) instrument: guaranteed payment & participation in any increase in value of an equity/index/asset
  - Participation instrument: payments depend on returns on an asset/index/interest rate (eg floating rate bond)
  - -> No guaranteed payment
  - Leveraged instrument, inverse floater: coupon rate inversely related to a reference rate
- 40:
  - Short-term funding alternatives available to banks: customer deposit, CD, central bank, inter-bank
  - Repurchase agreement: repo rate (interest rate for repo), repo margin (haircut), reverse repo
- 65:
  - Method for determining period of accrued bond interest:
    - Gov bond: actual day
    - Corp bond: 360 day year, 30 day month
  - Matrix pricing example
  - True yield: account for coupon payment delayed by weekends/holidays -> < street yield
  - Simple yield: adjust current yield using straight-line amortization of discount/premium (discount +, premium -)
  - Yield to call, yield to worst
- Discount margin = YTM - reference rate
- 66:
  - Par curve: show coupon rate for bonds of various maturities that would result in bond price = par value
    (spot rates dif for dif maturities)
  - Forward curve: curve of same time period, dif year into the future (eg 1y1y, 2y1y)
  - I-spread (interpolated spread): benchmark is swap rate
- 67:
  - Z-spread: spread that must be added to each spot rate on the benchmark curve to make PV = current price
  - Option-adjusted spread (OAS) for callable bond = Z-spread - call value
- 85:
  - Parties involved in securitization: seller/depositor, trust/issuer/SPE, servicer
  - Tranches: different classes of securities with dif claim to cash flow of underlying assets
  - Time tranching, credit tranching
- 86:
  - Prepayment risk: contraction, extension
  - Balloon risk: risk that the borrower will not be able to pay the balloon payment
  - -> ~ extension risk
  - RMBS:
    - Recourse/non recourse
    - Loan to value (LTV) ratio, meaning
    - Pass through rate: coupon rate of RMBS
    - Conditional prepayment rate: annualized measure of prepayment
    - Single monthly maturity rate (SMM): month-end measure of prepayment
    - PSA prepayment benchmark: monthly
    - Credit enhancement: usually used for non-agency RMBS
    - CMO:
      - Collateralized by pools of RMBS
      - Usually used tranching:
        - Sequential pay CMO: time tranching
        - Planned amortization CMO (PAC): PAC tranches & support tranches
  - CMBS:
    - Backed by mortgages on income-producing real estate properties
    - Non recourse -> credit risk -> use credit tranching
    - Call (prepayment) protection:
      - Loan-level: defeasance (use paid amount to buy gov securities),
        yield maintenance charge (must pay interest amount loss to lenders)
      - CMBS level: time tranching
  - Asset-backed securities (ABS): backed by non-mortgage financial assets:
    - Auto loan: fully amortizing, short maturities
    - Credit card:
      - Revolving debt, non amortizing
      - Lockout period: only interest paid, principal payment used to purchase additional receivable
  - CDO: collateralized debt obligation: structured securities backed by pool of debt obligation:
    bond, bank loan, RMBS/CMBS/ABS (structured finance CDO), credit default swap (synthetic CDO)
  - Covered bond: no SPE, asset remained on balance sheet. Asset is pooled & protected. Can recourse to both issuers & asset.
- 109:
  - Effective duration usage: bond with embedded option because change in interest rate may change future cash flow
  - Key rate duration
    - Def: price sensitivity to a spot rate of specific maturity
    - Usage: price sensitivity to change in shape of yield curve
  - Effect of change in YTM on duration: decreased (smaller) YTM -> price more sensitive to interest change -> increase duration
  - Effect of put/call provision on duration: decrease duration because YTM change has less effect on price
  - Term structure of yield volatility: relationship between maturity & yield volatility:
    short-term yield more volatile -> short term bond price more volatile
  - Empirical duration: estimate from historical data using models
  - -> Effective for flight to quality scenario:
    gov bond price increase (yield decrease) but corp bond price not increase (yield spread increase)
- 127:
  - Credit risk components: default risk (probability of default) & loss severity. Expected loss.
  - Spread risk = downgrade risk + liquidity risk
  - Priority of claims on corp debt:
    - Secured > unsecured > subordinated
    - Senior > junior
  - Issuer credit rating (usually apply to senior unsecured), issue credit rating, notching
- 128:
