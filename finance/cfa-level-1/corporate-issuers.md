  - Financial: additional risk to common stockholders due to debt financing (~ financial leverage)
### Capital investment
- Discount rate (in NPV calculation) = opportunity cost of capital (COC)
- Capital budgeting analysis usually applies to replacement/mandatory project, not research & development project (high risk)
- Capital component break point = value at which component's cost of capital changes / component weight in WACC
- Costs included in capital allocation process (calculating project's cash flow):
  - Externalities
  - Opportunity cost
  - Tax impact
- Costs not included in capital allocation process:

### Working capital & liquidity
- Bank lines of credit:
  - Uncommitted: may refuse to loan if circumstances change
  - Committed (regular/overdraft)
  - Revolving (vs committed line):
    - More reliable: longer term
    - Firm can borrow/repay fund as its need change overtime
- Working capital management approaches: conservative (vs aggressive):
  - Higher level of current assets financed with long term debt & equity
  - More liquidity, less financial risk, higher financing cost, lower return
- Sources of liquidity:
  - Primary: sources of cash from normal operations
  - Secondary: liquidating assets, renegotiating debt agreements, bankruptcy, reorganization
- Drags on liquidity: delay or reduce cash inflow
- Pull on liquidity: accelerate cash outflow
### Capital structure
- Estimation of WACC: always use target capital structure if available.
  Only use market value to estimate when target structure not available.
- Static trade-off theory (vs MM proposition with taxes): add the expected costs of financial distress (interest cost) to the model
- -> There is optimal level of debt financing, above which cost of financial distress > tax benefit of additional debt
- Agency cost of equity: cost of reducing conflict of interest between shareholders & managers (eg monitoring)
- -> Reduced by increased debt issuance (less free cash flow)
- Cost of asymmetric info: additional returned required by creditors/shareholders due to info asymmetry with managers
- Pecking order theory: managers prefer financing choice that least likely to send negative signals to investors
- -> Less visible better than more visible: internally generated capital (retained earning) > debt > equity
### Leverage
- Contribution margin = price - variable cost
