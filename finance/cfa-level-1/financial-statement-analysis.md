# Financial Statement Analysis
- Pay attention to the year above each column

## Income statement analysis
- Example:
  - <img src="resources/income-stm-1.png" width="600"/>
  - <img src="resources/income-stm-2.png" width="600"/>
- Dividends are not included in income stm or other comprehensive income
- -> Only used for calculating retained earnings, should not deduce it to get net income
- Calculate diluted EPS:
  - Number of new shares from stock option:
  num of options - num of options * option price / average market price (not end of period price)
  - Always calculate basic EPS and compare with diluted EPS, in case diluted EPS > basic EPS
  - Weighted average number of share calculation (p.42 Notes):
  weighted average number of share before the dividend date x dividend rate + weighted average number of share after dividend
- Trading securities unrealized gain affects net income,
available for sale unrealized gain affects equity via other comprehensive income

## Balance sheet analysis
- Example:
  - <img src="resources/balance-sheet.png" width="600"/>
- Trade receivables are reported at net realizable value, un-collectability already accounted for

## Cash flow statements
- Example:
  - <img src="resources/cash-flow.png" width="600"/>
- Types of activities classified by types of cash flow:
  - Operating:
    - Current assets & current liabilities
    - Net income
    - Interest received, dividends received
    - Interest paid
    - Tax paid
  - Investing:
    - Non-current assets
  - Financing:
    - Non-current liabilities
    - Issue/repurchase stocks
    - Dividends paid
  - IFRS:
    - **Received** interest, dividends can be operating/investing
    - **Paid** interest, dividends can be operating/financing
- Conversion of bonds into common stock is non-cash transaction, whether or not there is difference in value
- -> Disclose only in footnote to cash flow stm

## Financial ratios
- Total debt only include interest-bearing short/long debts (not account payable and other long-term debts)
- Interest coverage ratio: EBIT / actual interest payment

## Inventories
- Types of costs included in inventory:
  - Purchase
  - Conversion
  - Other costs to bring inventory to the present location & condition
- Types of costs expensed (not included):
  - Abnormal waste of inventory
  - Storage costs of inventory
  - Administrative & selling
- Type of inventory reporting that result in lowest write down:
  - Price increasing: LIFO: lowest inventory cost
  - Price decreasing: FIFO: lowest inventory cost
- Convert LIFO to FIFO:
  - Increase in net income = decrease in COGS * (1 - tax rate)
  - Lower cash: more tax paid: tax paid = LIFO reserve * tax rate
  - Increase in current asset: LIFO reserve - tax paid
- Reversal of inventory write-down: decrease cost of sales
- Inventory write-down: decrease inventory -> decrease COGS & higher net income compared to normal in later period
- Inventory write-up: maximum is previous write down
- Inventory valuation:
  - IFRS: lower of cost and net realizable value
  - GAAP: lower of cost, market value, or net realisable value depending upon the inventory method used

## Long-lived assets
- Cost that can be capitalized: interest paid - interest received from temporarily investing.
Preferred dividend cost can't be capitalized.
- Fair value model (can be used for investment property): increase/decrease in value reflected directly in income
- Asset purchase/development effect on cash flow:
  - Purchase: expense reduce operating cash flow
  - Capitalize: expense reduce investing cash flow & create asset for depreciation
- Useful lives must be disclosed when using cost model under IFRS
- Long-term contract revenue recognition method doesn't affect cash flow
- Revenue recognition methods:
  - Completed contract (GAAP): only recognize revenue when the entire project is completed
  - Percentage of completion (ie progress toward satisfying performance obligations):
  recognize profit corresponding to the costs incurred as a proportion of estimated total costs
  - Installment method: recognize profit in proportion to cash collected

## Income tax
- Higher tax base of asset = less depreciation = higher taxable income = more tax paid = tax asset
- Income tax expense (provision for income tax) = tax payable + dDTL - dDTA

    - Fundamental: relevance (decision-useful) & faithful representation (complete, no bias, no error)
    - Enhancing: comparability, verifiability, timeliness, understandability
- 51:
  - Multistep income stm: provide subtotal for gross profit
  - Expense categorization: by nature (eg depreciation), by function (eg COGS)
- 52:

    - Unusual/infrequent items: above income from continuing operations, before tax
  - Prospective change cases: an accounting estimate (eg useful life of asset), inventory cost flow method (GAAP)
- 53:
  - Vertical common size income stm: divide by revenue
  - Comprehensive income = net income + other comprehensive income, measure all changes to equity
  - Other comprehensive income: transactions that affect equity but not net income
- 74:
  - Classified balance sheet: separate current/non-current assets/liabilities
  - Current asset: asset expected to be used up/converted to cash in less than max(1 year, the firm's operating cycle)

    - Increase asset & equity: revaluation surplus in other comprehensive income. Asset increased in value on balance sheet.
    - Cash flow stm: no effect
  - De-recognition (disposal by sale): gain/loss = selling price - book value. Reported on income stm & CFI (affecting net income).
- 185:
  - Revaluation model (IFRS, can be used for PP&E):
    - Revalue assets based on fair value
    - Gain:
      - First recognized in income stm as gain to the extent of previous loss
      - Extra reported as revaluation surplus in shareholder's equity (other comprehensive income)
    - Loss:
      - First reduce revaluation surplus
      - Extra reported as loss in income stm
    - Disclosure:
      - Revaluation date
      - How fair value was determined
      - Carrying value using cost model
  - Impairment treatment:
    - IFRS:
      - When carrying value > recoverable amount (ie max(fair value - selling cost, value in use (ie NPV of future cash flow)))
      - Write down to recoverable amount
    - GAAP:
      - When carrying value > undiscounted future cash flows
      - Write down to fair value, or PV of future cash flow if fair value is not known
    - Effect:
      - Loss in income stm: recorded as operating expense -> reduce net income
      - No effect on cash flow: not reduce taxable income
      - Reduce asset value
      - -> Lower depreciation & higher net income in subsequent periods
    - Disclosure: loss amount & circumstances that caused the loss
- 186: investment property (IFRS):

    - Tax liabilities on the tax return
    - Tax due but not paid (on balance sheet)
  - Income tax expense: expense recognized in income stm
  - Valuation allowance: reduction of deferred tax assets based on likelihood that future tax benefit will not be realized
  - -> Reduce earning
  - Treatment of deferred tax liabilities for analytical purpose:
    - Not expected to reverse: as equity
    - Expected to reverse: as liabilities
- 205:
  - Asset's tax base (value for tax purposes), calculation: cost - accumulated depreciation on the tax return

  - Compliant > not compliant > fraudulent
  - Decision useful > bias reporting choice & estimate (aggressive/conservative) > actively managed earning
  - Earning quality
- 240:
  - Low quality report conditions: motivation, opportunity, rationalization
  - Mechanisms to discipline reporting quality: regulation, auditing, private contract
  - Treatment of non GAAP measure: explanation & reconciliation
- Accounting treatments by types of leases:
  - Short-term, low-value lease: report rent expense in income statement
  - For lessee, operating & financing lease:
    - Record right-of-use asset & lease liability on balance sheet. Value = PV of lease payments.
    - (Basically) Amortize the asset & reduce lease liability by each lease payment
  - For lessor:
    - Financing (capital) lease:
      - Remove lease asset, add lease receivable (value = PV of lease payments) to balance sheet
      - -> Record gain/loss = lease receivable value - lease asset book value
      - For each lease payment:
        - Amortize the lease receivable (as revenue)
        - Record interest amount as income
      - -> All are recorded as operating cash flow
    - Operating lease:
      - Keep leased asset on balance sheet, record depreciation expense normally
      - Lease payments reported as income, operating cash
- Lease disclosure: min lease payment in next 5 years & sum lease payment more than 5 years into the future
