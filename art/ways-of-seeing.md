# Impression
- Very difficult to read, especially the chapters with only images
- Hard to judge the validity of the arguments: my lack of understanding of art and history
- -> Need to come back and read a second time
- To understand art, need to understand:
  - The author background and perspective
  - The needs of the spectator, owner, buyer
- The arguments are strongly opinionated but also interesting: regarding oil painting, nudity
