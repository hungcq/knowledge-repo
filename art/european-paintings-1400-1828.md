## Renaissance art
- Center: Italy & Belgium
- Defining features of paintings:
  - Have the will to be more realistic than painting had been in the past:
    - Reflects the new curiosity about the natural world
    - Artists achieved this goal by studying their surroundings, by learning to reproduce the three-dimensional nature of objects and space 
    and by representing humans that moved and expressed their feelings.
  - Have a strong will to recover what was perceived as the greatness of classical antiquity:
    - Sculptors and architects copied ancient buildings and sculptures that existed in Europe
    - Very few ancient paintings remain
    - -> Painters filled their works with motifs, borrowed from ancient sculpture and architecture,
      and they also imitated works by ancient painters that they learned about from ancient Roman texts
    - Many Renaissance paintings showed mythological subjects
- Huge increase in portraits
- -> Central place of human beings
- Features of Italian paintings, compared with Northern painting:
  - More drawn to the reproduction of ancient ruins because more existed there
  - Placed a greater emphasis than their Northern counterparts in creating ideal beauty,
  based on the ideas of a harmony and proportion, as manifest in ancient art
