# Super Freakonomics

## Info
- Type: book
- Author: Stephen J. Dubner, Steven Levitt

## Intro
- Unifying theme of Freakonomics: people respond to incentives, though not necessarily
in way that are predictable or manifest
- Advs of using econ approach: inform, reality, understand the world  
-> Make decision based on reality rather than exceptions & anomalies 
- 2 types of stories:
  - Things you always thought you knew but didn't
  - Things you never knew you wanted to know but do
- Warrant about the content: might not be useful/conclusive. The aim is
only to start a convo.

## What is the book about
- Category: economics, behavior, data-driven. Mainly theoretical.
- Short summary: discuss various phenomenons/situations.
Present facts, data and some theories
to explain the situations and why some common thinkings are wrong.
Discuss some existing/potential solutions, why some didn't work,
why some did/should work.
Use the *economic approach* to analyze data,
describe rule about how people make decisions.
- Structure: *skipped, check out [Main Arguments](#main-arguments)*
- Author's problems:
  - Ask the proper question
  - Try to answer it using the *economic approach*

## Important Terms
- Economic approach:
  - Method of analysis to analyze human behavior. Describe how
  they make decisions in a systematic way.
  - Based on: data
  - Need to: ask the proper question
- Natural experiment: set of conditions that mimic the experiment
you couldn't conduct
- Behavioral economics:
  - Subfield of experimental econ
  - Blend traditional econ & psychology
  - Aim: capture elusive & puzzling human motivations

## Main Arguments

### 1. Various costs of being a woman
- Disadvs of women in the past & at the moment, wage gap
- Why prostitution (pros) persist: higher wage compared to other professions
- Why laws target pros (suppliers) don't work:  
lower supply -> higher price (wage) -> attract more pros to enter the market  
-> Target illegal goods/services: target buyers
- Why pros wage has fallen, compared to 100 years ago:  
shift in culture attitude: premarital, free sex
- Conditions for price discrimination:
  - Can categorize customers, some into willing-to-pay-more category
  - Seller can prevent resale of the product (no trading)
- Why quality of teachers has fallen:  
after the feminist movement: more job choices  
-> Women choose better job
- Women low representation in high-end jobs:
  - Lower GPA, fewer finance courses
  - Work fewer hours (kids)
  - More career interruption (pregnancy)
  - Best women marry best men -> no need to work (no data given)
  - Higher wage is not a meaningful incentive for women
- Difficulty in conducting experiments/gathering data explaining wage gap:  
many differences between 2 sexes

### 2. Aspects of life and death
- Role of luck in one's life examples:
  - Ramadan (Muslim fasting) effect on newborns
  - Relative-age effect: same year but ~12 months gap
- Raw talent vs deliberate practice (more important)
- Conjecture about why terrorists have good background:
  - Political act
  - Need to execute competently
  - Poor people have different things to worry about
- Econ effect of terrorism:
  - Fear
  - Post-traumatic stress
- Improvement of emergency room: more information  
-> Make faster, better medical decisions
- Measuring doctors' skills:
  - Prestigious school
  - Residency in prestigious hospital
  - More experience
- -> Gap is not big, other factors are more important
- Effect of hospital (measured when doctors leave for medical convention 
& when patient strike):  
good if serious, bad if not serious
- Mental factors affecting longevity:
  - Status
  - Religion
  - Money
- Difficulty in sing data to find terrorist:  
false positive overwhelms small num of real terrorists

### 3. Apathy & altruism
- Introduce the story -> apathy problem
- Reasons why crime rate increase in US from 1950-1970:
  - Lenient system: fewer arrests
  - More baby -> more in crime-involvement age
  - TV (interstate and in-state comparison thanks to dif in TV adoption)
- Measuring altruism in labs: common result (people are altruistic) and issues:
  - Selection bias: volunteered students have specific tendency for cooperation
  - Scrutiny: act difly when being observed
  - Context: artificial lab context, induce actions in accordance
  with what the researcher expected
- Suggestion from List's experiment (more closely resemble real-world context):  
when a person earns some money honestly and believes that another person
has done the same, she neither gives away what she earned nor takes what doesn't
belong to her
- Common motivation behinds giving: impure altruism: give to look good,
feel good/less bad  
-> People response to incentives & can be manipulated to be good or bad with
the right incentive.

### 4. Simple & cheap solutions
- The world is more hospitable compared with the past
- Example of simple & cheap solutions:
  - Hand-washing in preventing puerperal fever
  - Fertilizer in increasing agricultural output
  - Whale oil & oil
  - Vaccine & drug vs medical treatment
  - Seat belt vs expensive child safety seat

### 5. Data about global warming & some proposed solutions
- How & which human activity cause global warming:
  - CO2 from fossil fuel: not a potent greenhouse gas  
  -> Compared to CH4 (25x more potent) from ruminants -> food?
  - Difficulty in analyzing global warming:
    - Can't conduct control exp
    - Complexity: many factors, not all are taken into account by current models.  
    -> Can't do economic cost-benefit analysis reliably  
    -> Uncertainty leads to inaction. Wait for future cheap solution?
- Al Gore solution: reduce consumption & CO2 emission
- Externality & imposing tax on CO2:
  - Can't compute the right amount of tax
  - Cross-boundary problem
- Issue of current climate models: all try to reach a consensus
- Facts:
  - CO2 level rise following temp rise
  - High pollution dims the sun, cool the temp  
  -> Temp rise after we clean up the air
  - CO2 impact: diminishing return
  - Increase in CO2: good for plant & agri, problematic only when rising rapidly
  - Cause of rise in sea levels:
  primarily by thermal expansion of water, not ice melting
  - Tree could increase warming: dark leaves absorb light
- Problems of current solutions:
  - Too little: won't make a different
  - Too late: existing CO2 will remain in the atmosphere for several generations
  - Too optimistic: building alternative (to fossil fuel) power plants is not feasible
- Connection of big volcanoes & climate  
-> Solution to global warming: geo engineering: release S02 to upper layer of 
the atmosphere (stratosphere) to absorb water & form cloud, reduce sunlight  
-> Simple and cheap as not much SO2 is required
-> Compared to reducing CO2:
  - Affecting global economy, delay progress
  - Require change in human behavior, but no strong incentives (especially it's a 
  externality - no direct cost)  
  -> Need other solutions (engineering design/incentive), as education won't work

## What of it
- New look at global warming
- Change human behavior: need proper incentive, not a call for greater good
