- -> Provide a better explanation & understanding of the situation: OK
- Show that great media-metaphor shift has taken place in the US
- -> Most public discourse has become nonsense: OK
- Demonstrate by concrete examples how TV affect it: OK

## Style
- Expository, with examples
- Content is condense, arguments to the point

## Terms
- Conversation/discourse: all techniques and technologies that permit people of a particular culture to exchange messages
- -> = communication
- Message vs metaphor:
  - Message: a specific, concrete statement about the world
  - Metaphor: a suggestion of what a thing is like by comparing it to sth else
  - -> Fix a conception in people's mind -> always imagine one thing without the other (discourse = entertainment?)
- Age of Exposition: period of time during which the American mind submitted itself to the sovereignty of the printing press
- Age of Show business: period of time during which the American mind submitted itself to the sovereignty of TV
- Technology vs medium:
  - Technology: a physical apparatus
  - -> Has an inherent bias, tendency to be used in certain ways
  - Medium: a use of the physical apparatus

## Arguments
### Foreword
- Brave new world's warning is more relevant than 1984:
people will love technologies that provide distraction, deprive them capacity to think
- -> Risk of becoming a trivial culture

### 1. The medium is the metaphor
- Current situation:
  - All public discourse increasingly takes the form of entertainment:
    - Outlook > quality
    - Ability to entertain is highly valued
  - Largely there is no protest or notice
- Problem: many have observed the situation but most wasn't able to tell the origin and meaning of it
- -> Goal of the book: provide better explanation & understanding of the situation
- Premise:
  - Mode of communication -> (strongest but largely unnoticed influence) what ideas we can conveniently express 
  -> imp content of a culture, its intellectual and social preoccupations
  - Generalized: a technology not only extends man's power but also transforms his way of thinking & content of his culture
    (eg by allowing & enforcing new models to understand ourselves and the world)
- Main arguments:
  - TV demands dif kind of content from other media, esp typography: in images, not words
  - The decline of typography and ascendancy of TV have shifted the content and meaning of public discourse:
  all recasted in forms suitable to TV
  - -> Public discourse changed from being generally coherent, serious and rational to being absurd and nonsense
- To understand media influence, need to take into account:
  - Symbolic forms of info
  - Source of info
  - Quantity & speed of info
  - Context in which info is experience

### 2. Media as epistemology
- Scope: focus on epistemology - definition of truth & sources of such definitions, not aesthetic/literary criticism
- -> TV is not dangerous when it outputs undisguised junk, but when it attempts to carry imp cultural conversations
- Truth:
  - A kind of cultural prejudice: each culture conceives truth being most authentically expressed in certain symbolic forms
    (eg scientific truth is best expressed in number)
  - -> Affect def of intelligence (ability to grasp the truth of things)
  - Some ways of truth-telling are better than others & have healthier influence on the culture that adopt them
- Written words vs spoken words:
  - Greater prestige & authenticity
  - More serious
  - More thinking & editing efforts
  - More impersonal & objective
  - -> Addressed to the world, not an individual
  - Easier to verify or refute
- -> Writing is closer to the truth
- Defs of truth & intelligence are derived in part from character of media:
  - In oral culture: 
    - Truth is discovered and revealed by resources of speech (mnemonic devices, formulaic expressions & parables)
    - Intelligence:
      - Aphoristic ingenuity: power to invent compact sayings of wide applicability
      - Ability to memorize
  - -> Oral tradition has lost much influence in a print-based culture
  - In written culture:
    - Truth: organized around written material
    - Intelligence: have the abilities to:
      - Remain detached and objective to get to the arguments, theirs meaning & logic
      - Get the attitude of the author toward the subject & reader from the tone of language
      - Judge the quality of the arguments by:
        - Delay a verdict
        - Hold a question & determine where or if it is answered
        - Bring all relevant exp & knowledge as counterarguments
      - Negotiate world of abstractions
- Answers to counterarguments:
  - Not claiming that changes in media bring about changes in people's mind/cognitive capacity
  - -> The argument doesn't require it
  - The shift has not yet included everyone & everything: other forms of conversation will always remain as a residual epistemology
  - -> New form won't have an unchallenged influence: changes is gradual, then all at once (current situation)
  - TV pollutes public communications & its surrounding landscape, not everything. Its beneficial possibilities shouldn't be disregarded.

### 3. Typographic America
- AAmerica in 1700-1800s:
  - High level of literary, extended to all classes
  - Lots of books & newspapers
- -> Legacy of Protestant tradition & intellectual founders
- Printed word has heavy influence in the form of all public discourses (lineal, analytical structure) due to:
  - Quantity of printed matter
  - Its monopoly

### 4. The typographic mind
- Character of audience in typographic culture from Lincoln - Douglas debate example:
  - Accustomed to extended oratorical performance
  - -> Long attention span
  - Consider political debates as essential to political education
  - Not rely on special events to listen to oratory
  - Have capacity to understand lengthy & complex sentences, complex rhetorical resources (sarcasm, metaphors, fine distinctions, exposure of contradictions...)
  - -> Consider sophisticated literacy is crucial to citizenship
  - Have knowledge of historical events & complex political matters
- -> The use of language as a means of complex argument was important, pleasurable & common form of discourse in most public arena
- Characteristics of public discourse under the influence of typography (Lincoln - Douglas debate as example): expository:
  - Has a content: semantic, paraphrasable, propositional content
  - -> Demand to be understood, challenge the intellect
  - Coherent, orderly arrangement of facts & ideas
  - Assume audience are generally competent to manage such discourse
- -> Encourage seriousness, objectiveness & rationality
- Examples of public discourse in typographic US:
  - Religion: belief that reason alone is enough for enlightenment
  - Legal system:
    - Lawyers tended to be well-educated, devoted to reason, capable of impressive expositional argument
    - Belief that law must be a liberal subject (combined with other subjects)
  - Commerce: ads as example:
    - Assume potential buyers are literate, rational & analytical
    - Form: informational, propositional
    - -> In contrast with modern advertising: focus on aesthetic & psychological factors
  - Act of reading:
    - Printed matter has its monopoly on attention & intellect
    - Reading is an imp, serious activity, crucial to connect to and understand the world

### 5. The peek-a-boo world
- 2 technologies that changed public discourse mid-1800s:
  - Telegraph: enable transferring info instantly across distance
  - -> Impact on public discourse: when embraced by the press, it introduces:
    - Irrelevance: context-free info, serves no function in readers' lives, doesn't lead to any action or change of plan
    - -> Need new contexts to be use: for entertainment & distraction (eg cross-word puzzle, game show)
    - Impotence: info that provides no insight, doesn't permit action or right of reply
    - Incoherence: messages:
      - Without any explanation or analysis
      - To be replaced by more up-to-date messages
      - No connection with other messages
    - -> New def of intelligence: know of lots of thing, without actual understanding about implications, background & connections
  - Photography: replace language as a mean for understanding & testing reality
    - Dif between image & language:
      - Present only particularities, not ideas, abstract concepts
      - Lack a syntax
      - -> Can't argue with the world
      - Record experience without context, isolate image from context
    - Epistemological bias: accept the world as recorded by the camera
    - -> Surface level, not true understanding, which requires cross-examination
    - -> Photograph creates a sensory exp, a context for the context-free news
    - -> Illusion of understanding: the news is still totally self-contained & irrelevant
- -> New electronic media follows telegraph & photograph bias: film, radio...
- TV amplifies the bias, influences all areas of public discourse:
  - Why:
    - Wide audience: all ages & economic conditions
    - Cover all subjects of public interest: politics, news, education, religion, science, sports
    - Act as a meta-medium: direct knowledge of ways of knowing (eg about a subject, about other media)
  - Its impact is mostly invisible
  - -> The world influenced by TV is natural, not strange

### 6. The age of show business
- Why TV as a medium release its full potentialities as a technology of images in the US: suitable env:
  - Liberal democracy
  - Free market economy
- Why TV is loved: providing entertainment:
  - Visual delight
  - Short video -> always sth new to see
  - Variety of subject matter without the need to comprehend
  - Emotional gratification
- Why TV is threatening to a culture: not that it is entertaining, but that it makes entertainment the natural format for the representation of all exp
- -> As a meta-medium, how TV stages the world becomes model for how the world is properly to be staged
- -> The culture adopts a new way of conducting imp business: entertainment becomes the main goal, is prioritized over expertise
- Attributes of a TV show:
  - Aim: for entertainment
  - Mode of communication: mainly through visual images
  - -> Require performances, not ideas
  - Usually embedded in music to call forth specific emotions
  - Has time constraint & expectation of a fast tempo: showing people in the act of thinking is boring - no performance to see
  - -> Discussions: fragmented, in a short time, no argument, no response to argument, no explanation

### 7. "Now... this"
- The phrase "now... this" stresses the incoherence of matters presented on TV: separate events in short programs
- -> Typical of news programs
- Features of news on TV:
  - No context -> no contradiction between statements
  - No consequences & value -> not serious
  - Mix with music -> create mood, for entertainment
  - Average length of any story is 45s
  - -> No time to think. Thinking would obstruct attention to the next story -> no implication
  - Unnecessary & irrelevant images
  - Poker face newscaster
  - -> No emotion, no actual understanding -> joined by viewers
  - Followed by commercials
  - -> Degrade the imp of the news
  - Full of noise
  - Perception of truth depends on acceptability of newscaster
  - -> Impression is more imp than reality
- Consequences on audience:
  - Constantly changing opinion, no actual understanding
  - Not informed. Take noise to be knowledge.
  - -> Lose sense of what it means to be informed
  - Adjusted to incoherence & indifference
- TV create new paradigm for conception of public info
- -> Other media follow suit (newspaper, radio)

### 8. Shuffle off to Bethlehem
- How religion is presented on TV:
  - Can't consecrate the space to exp the show
  - -> Can't achieve required state of mind
  - Strong bias toward secularism: full of entertainment & commercials, before & after religious program
  - Main goal is to attract audience
  - -> Offer people what they want, not what they need
  - Fundamentalist: try to communicate with God directly, but the preacher is place at the center
  - -> Not suitable for the abstraction required by true religion
- -> Impossible to call forth authentic religious exp - spiritual transcendence
- Answers to counterarguments:
  - Full of decoration
  - -> For entertainment purpose, not enchantment. Not true objects belonging to traditional religion.
  - Religious show does attract lots of audience
  - -> Popularity of trivial religion drives out traditional religion
- Consequence: try to refashion religious services, to make them more televisible

### 9. Reach out and elect someone
- Attributes of TV commercial:
  - Claims in images, not proposition
  - -> Emotional appeal, not tests of truth, becomes basis of consumer decisions
  - Assumptions about the nature of communication:
    - Brief > long message
    - Drama > long exposition
    - Being solved solutions > having to confront with questions about problems
    - All problems are solvable & solvable fast through intervention of technology & techniques
- -> Affect American habit of thought, commerce & political discourse
- Effect of TV commercial:
  - On commerce: undermine rationality - basis of capitalist theory
  - On political discourse:
    - Require its form to be used in political discourse: use image, not word, with the focus on emotional & psychological factors
    - -> Politician present themselves as image of the audience, to address their psychological needs
    - -> No authentic political substance. No standard of excellence, only appearance of having one.
    - Make American accommodate themselves to new assumptions about the nature of communication
    - Make it not necessary to distinguish politics from other forms of social life:
    politicians become celebrities: can show up anywhere, doing anything
    - -> Move the voting focus from ideology of political party to politician
- Threat of TV on history:
  - TV is present-focused
  - History requires facts to be organized & patterns to be discerned
- -> History becomes irrelevant if people are incapable of expository thinking
- Threat of TV on liberal democracy - freedom of information: info env full of noise, with the goal to amuse, not inform
- -> The public can't distinguish between serious discourse and entertainment
- -> No need for censorship

### 10. Teaching as an amusing activity
- Why educational TV show is embraced:
  - Parent:
    - Feel less guilty when can't restrict children access to TV
    - Hope TV can teach sth
    - Relieved of the responsibility of teaching children
  - Educator: being told that new method of learning is efficient
- Differences between TV show and school:
- | School             | TV                   |
  |--------------------|----------------------|
  | Social space       | Private space        |
  | Can ask questions  | Can't ask questions  |
  | Focus on words     | Focus on images      |
  | Legal requirement  | Can choose to attend |
  | Fun is only a mean | Fun is an end        |
- -> What children learned from TV is irrelevant: learning how to learn is more imp than learning what is taught
- Attributes of educational TV show:
  - Content is chosen to be televisible, not educational
  - New educational philosophy: teaching & entertainment are inseparable:
    - No prerequisites: TV program must be a complete package in itself
    - -> Undermine idea of sequence & continuity in education & thought
    - No perplexity: to keep learners' attention. Information must be immediately accessible.
    - -> Nothing to be remembered, studied, applied or endured
    - -> Undermine perseverance & ability to restraint
    - No exposition: story-telling via dynamic images & music
- Why TV affects education: control a big portion of time, attention & cognitive habits of the youth
- -> TV controls the curriculum
- Consequences:
  - Decline of traditional classroom
  - Teaching & learning in classroom are redesigned as an amusing activities:
    - Increase visual stimulation
    - Reduce amount of exposition
    - Use entertainment to keep students' interest
  - -> No scientific evidence that learning is increased when information is presented in a dramatic settings

### 11 The Huxleyan warning
- Difficulties:
  - Not everyone believes that a solution is needed:
    - Unaware of the influence of technologies & media
    - Believe that progress is inevitable
  - There is probably no solution
- Suggestions:
  - Unrealistic solutions:
    - Eliminate TV
    - Limit availability of TV & certain types of content
    - Improve quality of TV programs
  - Goal: be more media-aware & information-aware:
    - Basic concepts regarding: information, television
    - Its effects & threats
  - -> Asking questions might be sufficient
  - Mean: education:
    - Create TV programs to educate
    - -> Ineffectual
    - Rely on schools:
      - Desperate, based on naive faith on efficacy of education
      - Not hopeless: educators have started to be "media conscious":
        - Question asked: how to use media/technology to control education
        - Question not asked: how to use education to control media/technology
        - -> Should be the center of the curriculum

## Criticism
- Examples & events in chap 3 seems like cherry-picked
- Arguments in chap 3, 4 are mostly historical & based on observation. Psychological/neurological causes are not provided.
- -> Author did claim at the beginning
- Discussion of TV news only focus on entertainment, not the emotional aspect (eg attraction of negative news)
- -> Some was mentioned in "Why TV is loved" in chap 6
- Some special terms are provided and used throughout the book (eg discourse, resonance, metaphor), but the definition is not clear-cut
- -> Simple English word should be more preferable (eg communication, influence)

## Takeaways
- Aware of and understand the implication and influence of media, and technology in general, in:
  - Form of content
  - Standard of truth and intelligence
  - Culture
- -> Bigger picture view
- New insights & new direction for deeper thinking about media & culture in the age of the Internet
