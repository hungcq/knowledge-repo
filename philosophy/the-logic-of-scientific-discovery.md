# Style

# Terms
- Synthetic statement: description of the world that can't be taken for granted.
  It is possibly true but not necessarily true.
- Analytic statement: true by definition, self-explanatory, have no informative value (eg frozen water is ice)
- Stratagem: trick
- Hypostatization: representation
- Problem of induction: the question whether inductive inferences are justified, or under what conditions
- Positivism:
  - Old: admit as scientific or legitimate only those concepts/notions/ideas which are derived from experience,
  logically reducible to elements of sense-experience (eg sensations, impressions, perceptions, visual/auditory memories)
  - Modern: see science not as a system of concepts but rather a system of stms
  - -> Admin as scientific or legitimate only those stms which are reducible to elementary statement of experience
    (eg judgements of perception, atomic propositions, protocol sentences
  - -> Criterion of demarcation is identical with the demand for an inductive logic
- Problems of the empirical basis: problems concerning the empirical character of singular statements & how they are tested
- Basic statement: a statement which can serve as a premise in an empirical falsification (statement of a singular fact)
- Objectivity of scientific statements: the fact that scientific theories can be inter-subjectively tested
- Naturalistic view: methodology is the study of actual behavior of scientists
- Give causal explanation of an event: deduce a statement which describes it, using as premises of the deduction
one or more universal laws, together with certain singular statements, the initial conditions
- Universal statements: hypotheses of the character of natural laws
- Initial conditions: singular statements apply to the specific event in question
- Singular prediction/effect: singular statement deduced from the universal statements & initial conditions
- Strictly universal statement: assertion about an unlimited number of individuals
- Numerically universal statement: assertion about a finite class of specific elements
within a finite individual or particular spatio-temporal region
- Individual concept: a concept in the definition of which proper names or equivalent signs are indispensable
- Universal concept: a concept which any reference to proper names can be completely eliminated

# Content
## Preface
- Central problem & interest in philosophy & science: understand the world
- The growth of knowledge can be best studied  by studying the growth of scientific knowledge
- Method of philosophy: rational discussion: state the problem clearly & examine its proposed solution critically
- -> Scientific kno is the extension of common sense kno
- Scientific kno can be more easily studied compared to common sense kno
- -> Problem of reasonable belief -> problem of accepting & rejecting sci theories
## Part 1: introduction to the logic of science
### 1. A survey of some fundamental problems
- Task of logic of scientific discovery (kno): to give a logical analysis of the method of empirical sciences
#### The problem of induction
- Problem of induction def
- Common view: empirical science use inductive methods
- -> Problem of induction
- -> Difficulties: infinite regress or a priori valid principle of induction
#### Elimination of psychologism
- Psychologism (psy of kno) vs logic of kno:
  - Psy of kno: how a new idea is created
  - Logic of kno: how the idea is systematically tested
#### Deductive testing of theories
- Positivism def
- Overview of the method of deductive testing:
New tentative idea (eg anticipation, hypothesis, theoretical system)
- -> Deduce conclusions logically
- -> Compare with one another & with other relevant statements to find what logical relations exist between them
- 4 ways to test a theory:
  - Logical comparison of conclusions among themselves: test for logical consistency
  - Investigation of the logical form: whether the theory is empirical or not (eg tautological)
  - Comparison with other theories: mainly to determine whether the theory would constitute a scientific advance
  - Deductive testing of empirical applications of the conclusions which can be derived from theory
  - -> How far the new consequences of the theory stand up to the demands of practice,
  which is raised by purely sci experiments or practical technological applications
- Deductive testing:
Singular stms (predictions) are deduced from the theory with the help of other previously accepted stms
- -> Select those that are not derivable from the current theory, especially those which the current theory contradicts
- -> Seek a decision regards these & other derived stms by comparing them with the results of practical applications & experiments:
  - Singular conclusions are acceptable (verified) -> the theory has passed its test for the time being
  - Singular conclusions are falsified -> the theory is falsified
- -> Positive decision can only temporarily support the theory, subsequent negative decisions might always falsify it
- -> Theory withstanding severe tests & not superseded by another theory -> corroborated by past experience
- -> The procedure is not inductive: truth/probability of theory not derived from truth of singular stms
#### The problem of demarcation
- Method of induction can't solve the problem of demarcation: can't distinguish between empirical sciences & metaphysical systems
- Positivist try to find the chars of empirical science & of metaphysics to distinguish them from each other
instead of proposing a convention
- -> Failure due to problem of induction
- Proposal for a criterion of demarcation as a convention
- -> Need to agree on the purpose of empirical science to decide the convention
- Value of the proposal: help to elucidate the problems of the theory of kno
- Metaphysical speculation has its value
#### Experience as a method
- Empirical science def: system representing the real world of exp
- -> Distinguished from other systems by the fact that it has been submitted to deductive testing method
#### Falsifiability as a criterion of demarcation
- Theories can't be verified by exp (inductive logic)
- -> Need a new criterion which allow unverified statements into empirical science
- -> Falsifiability as the criterion of demarcation (testable by exp)
- Addressing objections:
  - How falsifiability is better than verifiability: universal statements can't be derived from singular statements,
  but can be falsified by them (by means of purely deductive inference)
  - Evasion of falsification is possible
  - -> The method should be characterized to exclude those ways of evasion
#### The problem of the "empirical basis"
- Problems of the empirical basis def
- Basic statement def
- Singular statement must be empirical to serve as premisses in falsifying inferences
- Problem: perceptual exp can't justify basic statements: statements can only be logically justified by statements
- -> Solution depends on the distinction between objective logical relations & subjective exp
- -> Need to define objectivity
#### Scientific objectivity and subjective conviction
- Scientific objectivity def
- To be inter-subjectively testable, the statement must be universal - deal with events occurring regularly
- Statement of objective exp doesn't provide any justification for scientific statement
- -> Can only be considered as psychological statement - only meaningful to psychology
- Infinite regression: objective statement must be inter-subjectively testable
- -> Can derive from it other testable statements, but test can't be carried on forever
- -> Not a problem since scientific statements, according to the method, is not required to be tested, only testable

### 2. On the problem of a theory of scientific method
#### Why methodological decisions are indispensable
- Distinguishing char of science is its ability to advance, esp when there are conflicting systems of theories
- -> Empirical science should be characterized by its method of dealing with scientific statements
#### The naturalistic approach to the theory of method
- Naturalistic view def
- A system of methodological rules without a principle of induction is better:
the principle of induction is not needed, doesn't provide any value & gives rise to inconsistencies
- What is a science and a scientist always remains a matter of convention or decision
- -> Methodology should be a matter of convention
#### Methodological rules as conventions
- Main rule: other rules of scientific procedure must be designed in a way that they do not protect
any statement in science against falsification
- Value of the convention:
  - For science: allow the scientists to compare his work with the def
  - For philosophy: advance the theory of knowledge, deal with problems of older theories

## Part 2: some structural components of a theory of experience
### 3. Theories
#### Causality, explanation, and the deduction of predictions
- Causal explanation def
- Components of causal explanation:
  - Universal statements def
  - Initial conditions def (ie causes)
  - Singular prediction def (ie effect)
- The author won't make any general assertion as to the universal applicability of this deductive method of theoretical explanation
- Proposal: methodological rule: we are not to abandon the search for universal laws and for a coherent theoretical system,
nor ever give up our attempts to explain causally any kind of event we can describe
#### Strict and numerical universality
- 2 types of universal synthetic statements:
  - Strictly universal statement def (theory, natural law)
  - -> Cannot be replaced by a conjunction of a finite number of singular statements
  - Numerically universal statement def
  - -> Can be replaced by a conjunction of singular statements by enumerate all the elements of the finite class concerned
- Proposed convention: regard natural law as strictly universal statements. Numerically universal statements should be
considered singular statements
#### Universal concepts and individual concepts
- Individual concept def
- -> Must exist in singular statement
- Universal concept def
- The distinction has no relation with the distinction between class and element:
both indi and universal names may occur as names of some classes or elements

# Criticism
- Chap 8 (probability) is too technical
- -> Better be put in an appendix to avoid digression from main arguments
- Seem like a good understanding of quantum theory is required to understand chap 9
