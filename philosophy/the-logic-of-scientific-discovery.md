# Style

# Terms
- Synthetic statement: description of the world that can't be taken for granted.
  It is possibly true but not necessarily true.
- Analytic statement: true by definition, self-explanatory, have no informative value (eg frozen water is ice)
- Stratagem: trick
- Hypostatization: representation
- Epistemology (the logic of scientific discovery): the theory of scientific method, including:
  - Logical analysis of the relations between scientific statements
  - Choice of method: decisions about the way in which sci stms are to be dealt with
  - -> Depend on the aim we choose
- Problem of induction: the question whether inductive inferences are justified, or under what conditions
- Positivism:
  - Old: admit as scientific or legitimate only those concepts/notions/ideas which are derived from experience,
  logically reducible to elements of sense-experience (eg sensations, impressions, perceptions, visual/auditory memories)
  - Modern: see science not as a system of concepts but rather a system of stms
  - -> Admin as scientific or legitimate only those stms which are reducible to elementary statement of experience
    (eg judgements of perception, atomic propositions, protocol sentences
  - -> Criterion of demarcation is identical with the demand for an inductive logic
- Problems of the empirical basis: problems concerning the empirical character of singular statements & how they are tested
- Basic statement: a statement which can serve as a premise in an empirical falsification (statement of a singular fact)
- Objectivity of scientific statements: the fact that scientific theories can be inter-subjectively tested
- Naturalistic view: methodology is the study of actual behavior of scientists
- Give causal explanation of an event: deduce a statement which describes it, using as premises of the deduction
one or more universal laws, together with certain singular statements, the initial conditions
- Universal statements: hypotheses of the character of natural laws
- Initial conditions: singular statements apply to the specific event in question
- Singular prediction/effect: singular statement deduced from the universal statements & initial conditions
- Strictly universal statement: assertion about an unlimited number of individuals
- Numerically universal statement: assertion about a finite class of specific elements
within a finite individual or particular spatio-temporal region
- Individual concept: a concept in the definition of which proper names or equivalent signs are indispensable
- Universal concept: a concept which any reference to proper names can be completely eliminated
- Explicit definition: whereby concepts of an axiom system are given meaning in terms of a system of lower level universality
- Conventionalism: view theoretical natural science not as a picture of nature but merely a logical construction;
it is this construction which determines the properties of an artificial world:
a world of concepts implicitly defined by the natural laws which we have chosen. Sci speaks only in this world.
- Logical characterization of falsifiable systems: logical relations holding between the theory and the class of basic stms
- System of basic statements: all self-consistent singular statements of a certain logical form:
all conceivable singular statements of fact
- Psychologism: the doctrine that stms can be justified not only by stms but also by perceptual exp
- Protocol sentences: sentences which represent experiences

## Preface
- Central problem & interest in philosophy & science: understand the world
- The growth of knowledge can be best studied  by studying the growth of scientific knowledge
- Method of philosophy: rational discussion: state the problem clearly & examine its proposed solution critically
- -> Scientific kno is the extension of common sense kno
- Scientific kno can be more easily studied compared to common sense kno
- -> Problem of reasonable belief -> problem of accepting & rejecting sci theories
## I. Introduction to the logic of science
### 1. A survey of some fundamental problems
- Task of logic of scientific discovery (kno): to give a logical analysis of the method of empirical sciences
#### The problem of induction
- Problem of induction def
- Common view: empirical science use inductive methods
- -> Problem of induction
- -> Difficulties: infinite regress or a priori valid principle of induction
#### Elimination of psychologism
- Psychologism (psy of kno) vs logic of kno:
  - Psy of kno: how a new idea is created
  - Logic of kno: how the idea is systematically tested
#### Deductive testing of theories
- Positivism def
- Overview of the method of deductive testing:
New tentative idea (eg anticipation, hypothesis, theoretical system)
- -> Deduce conclusions logically
- -> Compare with one another & with other relevant statements to find what logical relations exist between them
- 4 ways to test a theory:
  - Logical comparison of conclusions among themselves: test for logical consistency
  - Investigation of the logical form: whether the theory is empirical or not (eg tautological)
  - Comparison with other theories: mainly to determine whether the theory would constitute a scientific advance
  - Deductive testing of empirical applications of the conclusions which can be derived from theory
  - -> How far the new consequences of the theory stand up to the demands of practice,
  which is raised by purely sci experiments or practical technological applications
- Deductive testing:
Singular stms (predictions) are deduced from the theory with the help of other previously accepted stms
- -> Select those that are not derivable from the current theory, especially those which the current theory contradicts
- -> Seek a decision regards these & other derived stms by comparing them with the results of practical applications & experiments:
  - Singular conclusions are acceptable (verified) -> the theory has passed its test for the time being
  - Singular conclusions are falsified -> the theory is falsified
- -> Positive decision can only temporarily support the theory, subsequent negative decisions might always falsify it
- -> Theory withstanding severe tests & not superseded by another theory -> corroborated by past experience
- -> The procedure is not inductive: truth/probability of theory not derived from truth of singular stms
#### The problem of demarcation
- Method of induction can't solve the problem of demarcation: can't distinguish between empirical sciences & metaphysical systems
- Positivist try to find the chars of empirical science & of metaphysics to distinguish them from each other
instead of proposing a convention
- -> Failure due to problem of induction
- Proposal for a criterion of demarcation as a convention
- -> Need to agree on the purpose of empirical science to decide the convention
- Value of the proposal: help to elucidate the problems of the theory of kno
- Metaphysical speculation has its value
#### Experience as a method
- Empirical science def: system representing the real world of exp
- -> Distinguished from other systems by the fact that it has been submitted to deductive testing method
#### Falsifiability as a criterion of demarcation
- Theories can't be verified by exp (inductive logic)
- -> Need a new criterion which allow unverified statements into empirical science
- -> Falsifiability as the criterion of demarcation (testable by exp)
- Addressing objections:
  - How falsifiability is better than verifiability: universal statements can't be derived from singular statements,
  but can be falsified by them (by means of purely deductive inference)
  - Evasion of falsification is possible
  - -> The method should be characterized to exclude those ways of evasion
#### The problem of the "empirical basis"
- Problems of the empirical basis def
- Basic statement def
- Singular statement must be empirical to serve as premisses in falsifying inferences
- Problem: perceptual exp can't justify basic statements: statements can only be logically justified by statements
- -> Solution depends on the distinction between objective logical relations & subjective exp
- -> Need to define objectivity
#### Scientific objectivity and subjective conviction
- Scientific objectivity def
- To be inter-subjectively testable, the statement must be universal - deal with events occurring regularly
- Statement of objective exp doesn't provide any justification for scientific statement
- -> Can only be considered as psychological statement - only meaningful to psychology
- Infinite regression: objective statement must be inter-subjectively testable
- -> Can derive from it other testable statements, but test can't be carried on forever
- -> Not a problem since scientific statements, according to the method, is not required to be tested, only testable

### 2. On the problem of a theory of scientific method
#### Why methodological decisions are indispensable
- Distinguishing char of science is its ability to advance, esp when there are conflicting systems of theories
- -> Empirical science should be characterized by its method of dealing with scientific statements
#### The naturalistic approach to the theory of method
- Naturalistic view def
- A system of methodological rules without a principle of induction is better:
the principle of induction is not needed, doesn't provide any value & gives rise to inconsistencies
- What is a science and a scientist always remains a matter of convention or decision
- -> Methodology should be a matter of convention
#### Methodological rules as conventions
- Main rule: other rules of scientific procedure must be designed in a way that they do not protect
any statement in science against falsification
- Value of the convention:
  - For science: allow the scientists to compare his work with the def
  - For philosophy: advance the theory of knowledge, deal with problems of older theories

## II. Some structural components of a theory of experience
### 3. Theories
#### Causality, explanation, and the deduction of predictions
- Causal explanation def
- Components of causal explanation:
  - Universal statements def
  - Initial conditions def (ie causes)
  - Singular prediction def (ie effect)
- The author won't make any general assertion as to the universal applicability of this deductive method of theoretical explanation
- Proposal: methodological rule: we are not to abandon the search for universal laws and for a coherent theoretical system,
nor ever give up our attempts to explain causally any kind of event we can describe
#### Strict and numerical universality
- 2 types of universal synthetic statements:
  - Strictly universal statement def (theory, natural law)
  - -> Cannot be replaced by a conjunction of a finite number of singular statements
  - Numerically universal statement def
  - -> Can be replaced by a conjunction of singular statements by enumerate all the elements of the finite class concerned
- Proposed convention: regard natural law as strictly universal statements. Numerically universal statements should be
considered singular statements
#### Universal concepts and individual concepts
- Individual concept def
- -> Must exist in singular statement
- Universal concept def
- The distinction has no relation with the distinction between class and element:
both indi and universal names may occur as names of some classes or elements
#### Strictly universal and existential statements
- Imp types of universal pure statements (only universal names and no individual names occur):
  - Strictly universal
  - Strictly existential: "there are", "there exist at least one"
- The negation of a strictly universal statement is always equivalent to a strictly existential statement and vice versa
- -> Theories of natural science can be expressed in the form of negations of strictly existential statements
or in the form of non-existence statements ("there is not" statements)
- -> Theories as prohibitions: deny that sth exist or is the case
- -> Falsifiable
- Strictly existential statements cannot be falsified. No singular statement (basic statement) can contradict them.
- -> Non-empirical or metaphysical
- Unilateral decidability: both kinds of strict statements are decidable one-way only
#### Theoretical system
- A tentative system can usually be quite well surveyed as a whole, with all its imp consequences
- -> Formulated sufficiently clearly & definitely
- -> Every new assumption can be easily recognizable for what it is: a modification and therefore a revision of the system
- Axiomatized system: when a set of statements, the axioms, has been formulated which satisfies the following requirements:
  - Free from contradiction, self or mutual
  - -> Not every arbitrarily chosen statement is deducible from it
  - Independent: not contain any axiom deducible from the remaining axioms
  - Sufficient: for the deduction of all statements belonging to the theory which is to be axiomatized
  - Necessary: contain no superfluous assumptions
- -> Enable the investigation of the mutual dependence of various parts of the system
#### Some possibilities of interpreting a system of axioms
- 2 interpretations of any system of axioms:
  - If the axioms are regarded as conventions then they tie down the use or meaning of the fundamental ideas
  or primitive terms or concepts which the axioms introduce; they determine what can
  and what cannot be said about these fundamental ideas (eg axioms of Euclidean geometry)
  - -> Not falsifiable (all analytic statements)
  - As a system of empirical or scientific hypotheses: systems that results from applying a rule:
  not to use undefined concepts as if they were implicitly defined
  - -> Enable evolution: new system cover old one
#### Levels of universality. The modus tollens
- Theoretical systems have statements with dif level of universality
- If a system of higher level of universality is falsified, the falsification may be attributed to the new hypothesis
- -> The old system of lesser universality is not required to be regarded as falsified

### 4. Falsifiability
#### Some conventionalist objections
- Conventionalism def
- -> Laws of nature are not falsifiable by observation; for they are needed to determine what an observation and
what a sci measurement is
- Conventionalism as a system is self-contained and defensible
- Conventionalists tend to select the simplest system
- -> Problem: attitude when the old system is challenged: try to explain away the inconsistencies of the old system
#### Methodological rules
- Empirical (refutable) systems should be distinguished by its methods
- -> The methods should prevent conventionalist stratagems
- Some common stratagems & handling methods:
  - Auxiliary hypotheses:
    - Only accept those whose introduction does not diminish the degree of falsifiablity or testability
    of the system in question, but increases it
    - -> The introduction of auxiliary hypotheses should always be regarded as an attempt to construct a new system
    - -> The new system should always be judged on the issue of whether it would, if adopted, constitute a real advance
    in our knowledge of the world -> open up new possibilities for testing and falsifying the theory
    - Allow singular statements which do not really belong to the theoretical system
      (eg assumption that certain observation or measurement which cannot be repeated may have been due to error)
  - Change in definitions: permissible if useful, but must be regarded as modifications of the system
  - -> The system has to be re-examined after as if it were new
  - Concern regarding the competence of the experimenter or theoretician: inter-subjectively testable experiments are
  either to be accepted, or to be rejected in the light of counter-experiments
#### Logical investigation of falsifiability
- Logical characterization of falsifiable systems def
- System of basic statements def
- -> Contain many stms which are mutually incompatible
- As opposed to metaphysical theory, empirical theory should allow us to deduce more emp singular stms
than we can deduce from the initial conditions alone
- An emp theory must divide the class of all possible basic stmts unambiguously into 2 non-empty subclasses:
  - Potential falsifiers: prohibited by the theory
  - Permitted stms
- A theory:
  - Make assertions only about its potential falsifiers: it asserts their falsity
  - Say nothing about the truth/falsity of permitted basic stms
#### Falsifiability and falsification
- Rules to determine under what conditions a system is to be regarded as falsified:
  - Non reproducible occurrences are of no significance
  - -> Accepted basic stms which contradict a theory are not sufficient to falsify it
  - Only falsify when a low level emp hypo which describes such an effect is proposed and corroborated
  - -> Falsifying hypo
#### Occurrences and events
- Expression in informal language:
  - Occurrence: described by a singular stm (basic stm)
  - Event:
    - What may be typical or universal about an occurrence
    - What, in an occurrence, can be described with the help of universal names
- -> A theory, provided it is falsifiable, rules out not merely one occurrence, but always at least one event
#### Falsifiability and consistency
- Consistency: the first requirement to be satisfied by every theoretical system, empirical or not
- Inconsistent system: uninformative because any conclusion can be derived from it
- Consistent system: divide the set of all possible stms into 2:
  - Those which it contradicts
  - Those with which it is compatible
- Relation between consistency and falsifiability: mostly analogous:
stms which do not satisfy the condition of consistency fail to differentiate
between any 2 stms within the totality of all possible stms

### 5. The problem of the empirical basis
#### Perceptual experiences as empirical basis: psychologism
- Trilemma: accept sci stms dogmatically vs justify them via stms (infinite regress) vs psychologism
- Psychologism def
- -> Science as the systematic presentation of our immediate convictions
- -> Problem: scientific stms expressed in universals can never be justified
#### Concerning the so-called "protocol sentences"
- Protocol sentence def
#### The objectivity of the empirical basis
- Epistemology should focus on:
  - How we test sci stms by their deductive consequences
  - What kind of consequences we can select for this purpose if they in their turn are to be inter-subjectively testable
- -> Should not focus on: how I can, having the experience S, justify my description of it, and defend it against doubt
- Process of sci: testing, not justifying using exp
- Sci suspend judgement about assertions which are not testable
- -> Those can at best suggest a problem
#### Basic statements
- Formal requirements for basic stms:
  - From a universal stm without initial conditions, no basic stm can be deduced
  - Universal stm and basic stm can contradict each other
- Basic stms have the form of singular existential stm:
  - There is a so-and-so in the region k
  - Such-and-such an event is occurring in the event k
- Singular non-existential stm: there is not
- Basic stms can be formed from the conjunction of 2 basic stms or from one basic & one non-basic stm
- Material requirement: the event mentioned in the basic stm must be an observable event
(inter-subjectively testable by observation)
- In material mode of speech: an observable event is occurring in a certain individual region of space and time
#### The relativity of basic statements. Resolution of Fries's trilemma
- Any basic stm can again in its turn be subjected to tests, using as a touchstone any of the basic stms
which can be deduced from it with the help of some theory, either the one under test, or another
- -> The need to stop only at a kind of stm that is especially easy to test
- When investigators doesn't agree, then either:
  - Continue the tests
  - Conclude that the stm is not inter-subjectively testable
- Resolution of the trilemma: experiences can motivate a decision, and hence acceptance or rejection of a stm, but don't justify it
#### Theory and experiment
- Basic stms are accepted as the result of a decision or agreement; and to that extend they are conventions
- -> With the goal of discovering objective truth, the decisions are reached in accordance with a procedure governed by rules
- Imp rule: only accept/reject basic stms when testing theories: raise searching questions about these theories,
to be answered by the acceptance of basic stms
- A random collection of stms can never add up to a sci
- Epistemological theory of experiment:
  - The theoretician puts certain definite questions to the experimenter
  - The experimenter, by his experiments, tries to elicit a decisive answer to these questions.
  All other questions he tries hard to exclude.
- -> Theory dominates the experimental work from its initial planning up to the finishing touches in the lab
- How to select theory: one which:
  - Has hitherto stood up to the severest tests
  - Is testable in the most rigorous way

# Criticism
- Chap 8 (probability) is too technical
- -> Better be put in an appendix to avoid digression from main arguments
- Seem like a good understanding of quantum theory is required to understand chap 9

# Takeaway
