# Structure
- Part 1:
  - Overview of main problem
  - In adequacy of existing solutions
  - Proposed solution
- Part 2:
  - Thorough, logical investigation of different components of the proposed solution:
    - Theory
    - Falsifiability, simplicity
    - Empirical basis
    - Testability
    - Probability
    - Corroboration
  - Example of application

# Goals
- Give a logical analysis of the method of empirical sciences
- Give a more detailed analysis of the method of deductive testing
- -> Show that, within the framework of this analysis, all the epistemological that inductive logic gives rise can be dealt with

# Style

# Terms
- Synthetic statement: description of the world that can't be taken for granted.
  It is possibly true but not necessarily true.
- Analytic statement: true by definition, self-explanatory, have no informative value (eg frozen water is ice)
- Stratagem: trick
- Problem of induction: the question whether inductive inferences are justified, or under what conditions

# Content
## Preface
- Central problem & interest in philosophy & science: understand the world
- The growth of knowledge can be best studied  by studying the growth of scientific knowledge
- Method of philosophy: rational discussion: state the problem clearly & examine its proposed solution critically
- -> Scientific kno is the extension of common sense kno
- Scientific kno can be more easily studied compared to common sense kno
- -> Problem of reasonable belief -> problem of accepting & rejecting sci theories
## Part 1: introduction to the logic of science
### 1. A survey of some fundamental problems
- Task of logic of scientific discovery (kno): to give a logical analysis of the method of empirical sciences
- Common view: empirical science use inductive methods
- -> Problem of induction
- -> Difficulties: infinite regress or a priori valid principle of induction
- Psychologism (psy of kno) vs logic of kno:
  - Psy of kno: how a new idea is created
  - Logic of kno: how the idea is systematically tested
- Overview of the method of deductive testing:
New tentative idea (eg anticipation, hypothesis, theoretical system)
- -> Deduce conclusions logically
- -> Compare with one another & with other relevant statements to find what logical relations exist between them
- 4 ways to test a theory:
  - Logical comparison of conclusions among themselves: test for logical consistency
  - Investigation of the logical form: whether the theory is empirical or not (eg tautological)
  - Comparison with other theories: mainly to determine whether the theory would constitute a scientific advance
  - Deductive testing of empirical applications of the conclusions which can be derived from theory
  - -> How far the new consequences of the theory stand up to the demands of practice,
  which is raised by purely sci experiments or practical technological applications
- Deductive testing:
Singular stms (predictions) are deduced from the theory with the help of other previously accepted stms
- -> Select those that are not derivable from the current theory, especially those which the current theory contradicts
- -> Seek a decision regards these & other derived stms by comparing them with the results of practical applications & experiments:
  - Singular conclusions are acceptable (verified) -> the theory has passed its test for the time being
  - Singular conclusions are falsified -> the theory is falsified
- -> Positive decision can only temporarily support the theory, subsequent negative decisions might always falsify it
- -> Theory withstanding severe tests & not superseded by another theory -> corroborated by past experience
- -> The procedure is not inductive: truth/probability of theory not derived from truth of singular stms
- 

# Criticism
- Chap 8 (probability) is too technical
- -> Better be put in an appendix to avoid digression from main arguments
- Seem like a good understanding of quantum theory is required to understand chap 9
