# Free Will

## Concept
- Oxford dictionary: the power of acting without the constraint of
necessity or fate; the ability to act at one's own discretion
- Author: the feeling of conscious agency, the feeling that you are the authors
of your thoughts and actions

## Inquiry questions
- Describe a way in which mental & physical process can give existence
  to freedom of choice?
- Describe a way in which mental & physical process can give existence
  to freedom of choice?
- Soul ? Did I choose to have my soul, not of a psycho?  
-> Luck is decisive

## Intro
- Thoughts & intentions emerge from background causes which we are unaware of
and have no conscious control over
- Conception of free will rests on 2 assumptions:
  - We could have behaved differently in the past
  - We are conscious of most of our thoughts and actions in the present
- Not even correspond to subjective fact about us: act of free will can't
be traced to a point of origin in our minds
- Related to:
  - Morality
  - Law
  - Politics
  - Religion
  - Relationship
  - Feeling of guilt
  - Personal accomplishment  
  -> Depend on viewing others as autonomous persons, capable of free choice
- No free will -> sinners & criminals = poorly calibrated clockwork  
-> No punishment, only rehabilitation & deterrence
- Deserve success?
- Why people are as they are? Why are we not like them?
When we trade place with them (atom for atom, same gene, same life experience,
same brain & body), we will become them, make the same decision
- Neuro disorder: only a special case of physical event giving rise
to thoughts & actions

## 1. The conscious origin of the will
- Conscious of only tiny fraction of info that the brain process in each moment
- Aware of current exp, but not neurophysical events that produce them  
-> Sometimes not event aware of our emotion (tone of voice...)
- Reflect a simple choice in daily habit: why A not B today?
  - Did I consciously choose it?
  - What if I switch to B? The impulse to switch is also of unconscious causes
  - Why  today?
- -> The intention to do A over B not originate in consciousness, only appears
in consciousness
- Experiment: use fMRI to monitor a brain region. Participant see a random letter
on a screen. Report which letter they saw when they choose to press on in 2 buttons.  
-> Can predict which button will be pressed 7-10s before the time they report
they made the decision consciously  
-> The brain determine what you will do before you consciously aware of what you will
do next
- Can I initiate event in my brain?
- Can feel free, but the fact that choice is predicted beforehand -> illusion
- Philosophical materialism: brain is a physical system, follows the laws of nature
-> Changes in it functional state & material structure dictate our thoughts & actions
- What if mind is made of soul-stuff?  
The soul unconscious operation grant me no more freedom than 
the unconscious physiology of the brain
- Don't know what your soul going to do next = not in control  
-> True in all cases where you wish to do differently than you do
- Not related to voluntary & involuntary actions:  
Voluntary = has felt intention to carry out  
-> Say about the character of a person, how he will behave in the future  
-> Don't know where intentions themselves come from, what determine their character
in every instance  
-> We don't know what we intend to do until the intention itself arise  
-> Can't appreciate this -> have sense of free will
- We are not responsible for character of our mental lives & subsequent behavior.
- What it means to have free will?
  - Completely aware of all factors that determine your thoughts & actions
  - Have complete control over these factors

## 2. Changing the subject
- Determinism: prior causes -> unconscious neural events -> thoughts & actions
- Compatibilism: dif notion of free will: a person is free as long as he is
free from any outer or inner compulsions that would prevent him from acting on
his actual desires & intentions  
want -> act without being forced = free will  
!= common feeling: we are the authors of our thoughts & actions, we could have 
behaved difly as a conscious agent (not by random influences), we could resist the
impulse to do so, with the universe, including our brains, in precisely the same
state at that moment  
-> Make people responsible for their actions
- When we see the stream of causes preceding conscious decisions, back to childhood
& beyond  
-> Nothing to blame
- Compatibilism: a puppet is free as long as h love his strings:
  - Act on a desire -> free will: but many competing desires at 1 moment, many  
  even subjectively undesirable  
  -> No freedom when 1 desire triumphs its rivals
  - If no competing desire, the desire is still a product of prior causes
- Am I free to do the thought which does not occur to me to do?
- Thoughts & actions, even if unconscious, still ours  
(function of consciousness to neural processes controlling actions
still not identified)  
-> Trade psychological fact (subjective exp of a conscious agent) with
conceptual understanding of ourselves as persons. "We" includes everything
goes on inside our bodies != channel of info in conscious mind that people
identify themselves with  
-> Are you producing red blood cells, diverting enzyme at this moment?  
-> Are you responsible for these things because it is all "you"?  
-> No relation to common, enduring notion of free will
- 90% cell in our bodies belong to microbes like E.coli. Are they "you"? Are you
responsible for them?

## 3. Cause and effect
- Human actions can be reduced to a series of impersonal events
- Scientist looking for chance & quantum uncertainty  
-> Chance events are outside my control. If they affect my decisions, they are
surprising event to me

## 4. Choices, efforts, intentions
- Dif between premeditated, voluntary action & mere accident can be preserved  
-> Can preserve moral & legal concerns
- Certain states of consciousness arise automatically (hearing & sound) vs other
seemingly self-generated, deliberate (choose not to pay attention to it)  
-> Volitional vs non-volitional states of mind, governs by dif systems of the brain  
-> The dif produces the felt sense of free will
- Certain behaviors require the presence of conscious thought  
-> Consciousness is not inconsequential  
But I don't create the conscious thought. It just appears.
- Determinism != fatalism: sit back and not do anything is a choice, require effort
- Choice can depend on prior causes, but still matters. It causes other events
in the world.
- No responsibility from the perspective of conscious awareness
- Story of life (and will power):
  - Experience of life gone off track. Attempt to change but unable to.
  Freedom of will?
  - When it go on track again, through resolution, self-discipline & effort,
  how can you account for the ability to make those efforts, today and not 1 year ago?  
  Did you create the idea that change your life? Why not create the next one now?  
  -> You can say what is the dif this time around, but it is just
  a post hoc description of events outside your control
- The conscious part (agent) can't control because it lives
at the mercy of other parts  
You can do what you decide to do, but can't decide what you will decide to do  
You can create a framework which certain decisions are more likely than others.
But you don't know why you can submit to such framework today and not yesterday.  
Will power is important, but still a biological phenomenon. You can't have more
or less of it at a particular moment.
- To say "I could have done otherwise" is merely to think the thought "I could have
done otherwise" after doing whatever I in fact did  
-> Confuse hope for the future with an honest account of the past
- What I will do next is a mystery - fully determined by prior state of the universe
& laws of nature (including chance factors)
- We do not choose to pursue dif line of thoughts/interpretations
- Think about the context in which your next decision occur & what you have chosen:
  - Parent & place of birth
  - Gender
  - Most of life experiences
  - Genome
  - Brain development
- -> Now the brain is making choices on the basis of preferences & beliefs that
have been hammered to it over a life time - by genes, physical development
since conception, interactions with other people, events & ideas
- When stop doing sth: other things become more important. But why they become
more important at exactly that moment, to that degree?
- When I read a book & decide to act: why did I find it compelling? Why was it
sufficient to provoke my action, and not others'?

## 5. Might the truth be bad for us?
- Telling the truth about free will does have undesirable psychological/cultural
consequences
- But in can also improve our ethics:
  - Improve compassion & forgiveness
  - Diminish sense of entitlement to fruits of my own luck
- -> Such state of mind is not desirable in certain situation (eg self-defense).
Scientific, ethical & practical truths appropriate to certain situation  
eg we don't see things & people as collection of atoms, but it doesn't negate the truth
& utility of physics
- It does not make me fatalistic but increase sense of freedom. Hopes, fears & neuroes
less personal & indelible. I don't know how much I might change in the future. I won't
draw a lasting conclusion about myself. A small event might radically transform
my life.
- Being sensitive to background causes of thoughts & feelings can allow greater
control over one's life  
-> Realize you are a puppet and you can grab a hold on a string. Getting behind
conscious thoughts & feelings can allow to steer a smarter course through our life

## 6. Moral responsibility:
- Belief in free will: no religious conception of "sin" (great cruelty & punishment - 
the soul - because it can't be influence materially) & retributive justice
- Need new notion of personal responsibility to fit the facts, to continue to see
people as people
- Responsible = actions consistent with my thoughts, intentions, beliefs & desires
- Not responsible = out of character behaviors
- Judgements of responsibility depend on the overall complexion of one's mind,
not on metaphysics of cause & effect
- The brain should be the thing responsible
- What should be condemned: conscious intention to do harm  
-> If actions out of character -> huge threat to others
- Why conscious decision & planning worth consider: it reflects global properties of
our minds: beliefs, desires, goals, prejudices...  
-> Reflect what a person really is
- The  point is not that you are the ultimate cause of  your action. It is that for
whatever reasons, you have that character.
- Need to change some moral intuition: fear instead of hate
- 2 cases should be the same:
  - Kill for no reason
  - Kill for no reason, but have brain tumors affect it
- System of justice should reflect an understanding that each person could be dealt
a very dif hand (bad genes, bad parents, envs, ideas)  
-> Morality depends on luck  
-> Punish who? Gene, env, parent, luck?
- Can retain criminal justice system by assessing threat to society  
-> Revenge or punish should be weight with human happiness, consider for
deterring effect

## 7. Politics
- Entitlement? Fruit of hard work?  
-> Need to be lucky to be able to work, to be intelligent, healthy, not bankrupt...
- Ability to try hard, persist are results of gene & upbringing
- Don't need free will. Only need to ack that efforts matter & people can change
- Improving ourselves & society = working with forces of nature

## 8. Conclusion:
- Our sense of freedom results from our not paying close attention to what it is like
to be us
- When pay attention, we will see that free will can't be found & our exp is perfectly
compatible with this truth
- Free will make no sense objectively & subjectively. Just do a simple introspection:  
I will say anything from now. Whatever I say, I chose to say. No one compelling me.
I can even mention Taleb, I'm free to do so. But where Taleb come from? Why not
Socrates? What other philosophers haven't come to my mind? Why philosophers,
not colleagues or friends' name?
