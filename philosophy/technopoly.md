### 9. Scientism
- Scientism beliefs:
  - Principles of physical science applied to human behavior study -> social science: facts, theories, laws
  - -> Scientist: authority, prestige
  - Social laws can be used for social engineering -> control, authority
  - Science can solve human problems (eg meaning, well-being) -> control, authority
- Distinction:
  - True science: study processes: events in nature: regular, explainable, predictable
  - Shit science: study practices: artificial, human events
- Comparison: natural vs social science:

  | Empiricism:<br/>observe -> evidence<br/>-> supporting arguments -> conclusion | - Highly objective<br/>- Objects are indifferent to being studied | - Bounded by time, situation, cultural prejudices, specific condition<br/>- Lab experiments: subjects affected by env & how questions are framed<br/>-> Not universal |
  | Falsifiability                                                              | Yes                                                              | - Not predictable<br/>- Full of contradictory examples in reality<br/>- Ambiguous terms                                                                               |

- Social science: documenting the behavior & feeling of people as they confront problems posed by their culture
- -> ~story telling, literature: subjective interpretation of human nature, supported by examples
- Comparison: social science vs story telling:
- 
  |         | Social science                                           | Story telling        |
  |---------|----------------------------------------------------------|----------------------|
  | Form    | Exposition                                               | Fiction              |
  | Focus   | Wider population                                         | Based on individuals |
  | Method  | Use abstract social facts<br/>-> Reason, logic, arguments | Showing              |
  | Purpose | Persuasion                                               | Entertainment        |
- Why social science is embraced in current culture:
  - Technopoly preference for objectivity, facts, science
  - Failure of religion -> lack of meaning & moral authority
  - Lack of understanding about science
- Scientism = 3 beliefs + embrace without question + expect science to solve moral problems, tell us what to do

## Criticism
- The education reform proposal is interesting and insightful, but it is hard to see how it can be achieved

## Takeaway
- Information control mechanism & information glut
- Impacts of technology on culture, esp of invisible technology
- Understanding & awareness of scientism
- Goal of education in the past & in technopoly
- What a coherent education is
