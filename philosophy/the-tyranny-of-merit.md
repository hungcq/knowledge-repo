## Content
### Introduction
- The college admission fraud
- Unfairness in college admission
- Common sentiment in public view: problem with meritocracy is not the principle with the failure to live up to it
- Discussion of root causes:
  - Elite college's economic meaning
  - Moral justification of merit: earned success

### 1. Winners and losers
- Misdiagnosed causes of populist nationalism:
  - Bigotry
  - Economic complaint
- -> Problem: moral & cultural: loss of social esteem
- Diminished economic & social status of the working people is not the result of inexorable forces
but of the way mainstream political parties & elites have governed
- Main issues: how the project of globalization has been conceived and carried out:
  - Technocratic way of conceiving the public good: market mechanism as the primary instrument:
    - Increase inequality
    - Devalue national identities & allegiances
    - Treat many public questions as matters of technical expertise beyond the reach of ordinary citizens
  - Meritocratic way of defining winners & losers:
  even perfect meritocracy (perfect equality of opportunity) would not be satisfying. Problems of meritocratic ethic:
    - Moral issues:
      - Talent is not earned
      - Bad attitudes among the winners - hubris & among the losers - humiliation & resentment
    - Political issue: division between elite winners vs losers, fused by humiliation
- Public sentiments against Democratic party
- Conceptions of merit relevant to governing:
  - Old: moral & civic virtue
  - -> Technocratic version of meritocracy severs the link between merit & moral judgement
  - New: technical expertise
  - -> Fail to address the large moral & civic questions
- Impact on democracy:
  - Failure as a mode of governance
  - Narrowed the civic project: common good is understood mainly in economic terms
  - -> Impoverished public discourse
  - Political division
- Low social mobility in the US, as opposed to general belief
- -> Meritocracy is not an answer to rising inequality, only a justification of it
- -> Redistribution of income as a better working solution

### 2. Great because good: a brief moral history of merit:
- Advs of hiring based on merit:
  - Efficiency
  - Fairness: no discrimination
  - Affirming idea of freedom: destiny is in our hands
- Problem: place great weight on the notion of personal responsibility
- -> Responsible for one's lot in life is different from responsible for acting morally
- Similarity with biblical view:
  - Emphasis on human agency
  - Harshness toward those who suffer misfortune
- History of the rise of work ethic
- Relation between old & new view
- Development of the new view
- -> Not necessarily tie to religious assumptions, but any ethics that stresses free will & responsibility

### 3. The rhetoric of rising
- Rise of meritocratic idea in public discourse:
  - Personal responsibility: in attempts to rein in the welfare state & shift risks from govs & companies to individuals
  - Rhetoric of rising: promise that those who work hard & play by the rules
  deserve to rise as far as their talents and dreams will take them
- Reason for the lack of interest in the rhetoric of rising: considered as platitude describing current social order
- -> Many working class populist parties supporters are interested more in reassertions of national sovereignty, identity & pride
- Mistaking aspiration for fact: perfect equality of opportunity has not been achieved

### 4. Credentialism: the last acceptable prejudice
- Popularity of credentialism
- Education as the answer to inequality & the mean to compete in a globalized economy
- -> Eroded social esteem for those who had not gone to college
- Meritocratic idea: high credentials = deserve high position & income
- Prejudice of educated people against the less-educated. Accepted by the less-educated.
- -> Cause: low educational achievement considered as failure of individual effort
- Government by degree: trend & its lack of success:
governance requires dif set of skill than provided by uni education: practical wisdom & civic virtue
- Diploma political divide: shift of support of educated & non-educated people:
  - Educated: conservative -> liberal
  - Less-educated: liberal -> conservative
- Technocratic approach to governance:
  - Misinformation identified as main causes of bad political decision.
  - Problems: paternalism: place decision making in the hands of elites & dis-empower ordinary citizens
- -> Political debate is often about identity & framing fact, not about agreeing on the facts
- Climate change debate as an example that being more informed is not the cause of having dif opinions

### 5. Success ethic
- Comparison of meritocracy with aristocracy
- Public discussion are mainly about how to implement meritocracy right, not about meritocracy itself
- Objections to meritocratic society:
  - Justice:
    - Talent is a matter of luck:
      - Born with it
      - Live in a society that values it
    - Overestimated role of effort
    - 2 objections in alternative philosophies:
      - Free-market liberalism - F.A. Hayek: income doesn't reflect merit (moral deservingness)
      - -> Should not redistribute/enable income based on merit
      - Welfare state (egalitarian) liberalism - John Rawls: talent & effort = luck
      - -> Allow full use of talent, but redistribute: share with less lucky people
    - -> Common view: in pluralist societies, people disagree about what counts as meritorious or virtuous
    - -> Just merit using one system would undermine freedom
    - Failure of alternative philosophies in rejecting idea of market income as reward for merit:
      - Free-market liberalism: no clear distinction between contribution to society & market value
      - Welfare state liberalism: basic structure of society should be found based on consideration of justice,
      then applied to consider what is good
      - -> Problem: still fue the hubris, as the talented consider the reward as a way to make society well-off
      - -> Honor and recognition should also be considered as part of distributive justice
      - Luck egalitarian: a just society should compensate people for bad luck of all kinds. Problems:
        - Assert very expansive notion of responsibility. Eg: not buying insurance -> need to defend that no such choice was available
        - -> Hard to distinguish between chance & choice
        - To qualify for public assistance, must present & conceive of themselves as victims of forces beyond their control
        - -> Humiliation: welfare recipients viewed as lacking agency, incapable of acting responsibly
  - Attitudes toward success and failure
#### Additional info
- Why society has the right to claim the benefits of the talented:
the community enables success in various way (eg culture, infra)
- Market value is different from moral contribution: demand is mostly created by the economic system
- -> Ethical assessment of an economic system must consider the kind of wants it tends to generate or nourish,
not only its efficiency in satisfying wants existing at any given time

### 6. The sorting machine
- Colleges & uni as the main mechanism that societies allocate opportunity
- Origin & history: goal: find the most talented, not the privileged to lead society
- Results:
  - SAT scores track wealth: measure preparation more than talent
  - Low social mobility, rising inequality. Cause: most of the students are well-off in the first place
- Affirmative actions that can make the meritocratic system fairer
- Problems:
  - Unhealthy for democracy: sorting not only direct to appropriate social roles, but have implication of merit & social contribution
    - On winners: very demanding high school year for rich kids -> psychological damage:
      - Unable to see success as anything aside from effort
      - Focus on grade, reduced intellectual curiosity
    - On social esteem of losers
  - Negative impact on education: competition is also high in uni (eg student org)
  - -> Uni distracted from its main function: educating, not providing credentials
- Proposals:
  - Deal with sorting & striving:
    - Pick the qualified applicants by lottery
    - Advs:
      - Treat merit as a threshold qualification, not an ideal to be maximized
      - -> Reduce stress on high school years & hubris of winners
      - Emphasize that talent is not sth measurable
    - Meeting objections:
      - Academic quality concern: depends on setting the right threshold -> can experiment
      - Diversity, legacies & donor children: can change randomize algo
      - Prestige of top colleges & unis: should focus on education, not sorting prestige
  - Restore social esteem for people who are not selected:
    - Broaden access to four-year public colleges & unis
    - Devote greater support to community colleges, technical & vocational education, and job training
    - Popularized moral & civic education

### 7. Recognizing work
- Current situation:
  - Increased rate of death of despair
  - Increased resentment due to:
    - No more white privilege
    - Affirmative action which put minorities ahead
- Problem of economic redistribution: doesn't provide the social esteem of producing what society needs & values
- -> Focus on consumer side, not producer side
- Civic conception:
  - Common good is not simply about adding up preferences or maximizing consumer welfare
  - Common good is about reflecting critically on our preferences so that we can live worthwhile & flourishing lives
  - Most imp role we play in the economy is not as consumers but as producers
  - -> The value of our contribution depends on the moral & civic imp of the ends our efforts serve
- Why maximizing consumption is easy: can avoid the hard question of what should be considered good
- Proposals:
  - Conservative proposals:
    - Wage subsidy for low income worker
    - Trade restriction & other conservative approach to protect jobs
  - Liberal proposals: taxing the finance industry: produce little value compared to income
  - -> Taxation is not only a way of raising revenue,
  but also a way of expressing a society judgement about what counts as a valuable contribution to the common good
- Need for discussion about what kind of work is worthy
- -> Need to deliberate about the common life
- -> Rebuild the social bond

## Criticism
- Too much history & quotation & repetition: I don't give a fuck about what the US presidents said?
- Too much states, some seems like cherry-picked
- -> Should have just keep in ref
- Chap 2: how come the abuse of a phrase signifies that much?
- Chap 5 p.151: they did assert that income is a matter of market demand?
- Chap 7:
  - Random stats & comparison with VN war
  - Consumption tax is regressive tax

## Takeaway
- Understanding of important contemporary matter: populist backlash & its causes
- Understanding of meritocracy & its problems & some proposed solutions
