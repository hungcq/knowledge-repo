## Info
- Type: paper
- Author: Nick Bostrom

## Category
- Philosophy
- Technology

## Structure
- Substrate independence assumption from philosophy of mind
- Empirical consideration
- Core argument & formalization
- Conclusion: 3 possibilities

## Main content
- Substrate independence: replication at individual synapses is sufficient
- Ancestor simulation (vs selective simulation): whole human race
- -> Higher possibility: others in the env need consciousness to behave like human
- Notation:
  - fp: fraction of all human‐level technological civilizations that survive to reach a posthuman stage
  - N: average number of ancestor‐simulations run by a posthuman civilization
  - H: average number of individuals that have lived in a civilization before it reaches a posthuman stage
  - f1: fraction of posthuman civilizations that are interested in running ancestor‐simulations
  - N1: average number of ancestor‐simulations run by such interested civilizations
