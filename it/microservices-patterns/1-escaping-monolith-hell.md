## 1. Escaping monolithic hell
- Monolithic architecture:
  - <img src="../../resources/microservices-patterns/1.1.png" alt="drawing" width="500"/>
  - Suitable for new, small app
  - Benefits when the app is small:
    - Simple to dev: suitable for IDE & dev tools
    - Easy to make radical changes
    - Easy to test
    - Easy to deploy
    - Easy to scale
  - Drawbacks when the app is big:
    - Too complex -> difficult to dev & debug
    - Dev is slow: lag IDE, slow build, long start up time -> edit, build, run, test loop takes a long time
    - Path from commit to deployment is long:
      - Many devs -> hard to merge & need further testing
      - Complex -> need careful, system testing
    - Difficult to scale: conflicting resource requirements from dif modules
    - Not reliable:
      - Hard to test thoroughly
      - Lack of fault isolation
    - Locked into an obsolete tech stack: rewrite whole app is risky
- Software architecture mainly affect nonfunctional requirements (maintainability, extensibility, testability), not functional requirements
- 3 ways to scale an app:
  - Load balance requests across multiple instances:
    - Randomly
    - Based on request's attribute
  - Decompose by function into multiple services. Can be combined with load balancing.
- Microservice architecture:

  - Suitable for large, complex app
  - Benefits: of small, independent services:
    - Enables the continuous delivery and deployment of large, complex apps (most imp benefit):
      - Testability
      - Deployability: usually don't require coordination
      - Autonomous, loosely coupled teams
    - Maintainability
    - Scalability: based on resource requirement of each service
    - Easy to experiment & adopt new techs
    - Reliability:
      - Better fault isolation
      - Easier to test
  - Drawbacks:
    - Difficult to find the right set of services
    - -> Can result in distributed monolith
    - Complex distributed system:
      - IPC
      - Partial failures
      - Transactions & queries spanning multiple services
      - Dev: not supported by IDE, hard to do automated testing multiple services
      - Operational complexity: management & deployment
    - -> Require sophisticated dev & operation skills
    - Need coordination when deploying features spanning many services
    - Difficult to decide when to adopt
  - -> Many issues has multiple solutions, each with different set of tradeoffs
- Pattern:
  - Describe:
    - Issues
    - Result:
      - Benefit: solved issues
      - Drawback: unsolved issues
      - New issues
    - Related patterns
  - -> Objective -> better decision making
  - Can be organized into group: handle problems in a particular area
  - Pattern language: collection of related patterns that solve problems within a particular domain
- Microservice pattern language:
  - Software pattern: solves a software architecture or design problem by defining a set of collaborating software elements:
    - Object-oriented pattern: contains collaborating classes
    - High level design pattern: contains collaborating services
  - 3 layers:
    - Infra patterns: solve infra issues outside development
    - App infra patterns: solve infra issues related to development
    - App patterns: solve development problems

  - Groups:
    - Decomposition:
      - <img src="../../resources/microservices-patterns/1.11.png" alt="drawing" width="500"/>
    - Communication:
      - <img src="../../resources/microservices-patterns/1.12.png" alt="drawing" width="500"/>
    - Data consistency:
      - <img src="../../resources/microservices-patterns/1.13.png" alt="drawing" width="500"/>
    - Data query:
      - <img src="../../resources/microservices-patterns/1.14.png" alt="drawing" width="500"/>
    - Deployment:
      - <img src="../../resources/microservices-patterns/1.15.png" alt="drawing" width="500"/>
    - Observability
    - Automated testing
    - Crosscutting concerns
    - Security
- Process & organization:
  - Imp for success, beside architecture
  - <img src="../../resources/microservices-patterns/1.16.png" alt="drawing" width="500"/>
  - Organization: team of teams, each 8-12 people:
    - Each team has clear business-oriented goal:
      developing and possibly operating one or more services that implement a feature or a business capability
    - Cross-functional, can develop, test, and deploy its services without having to frequently communicate or coordinate with other teams
    - Grow: adding teams
  - -> Higher dev velocity, clear point of contact
  - Development & delivery process: agile dev & deployment practices (eg Scrum, Kanban)
  - Transition from monolithic to microservice architecture: need to consider reaction & emotion of people
