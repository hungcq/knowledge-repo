# Terms
- Pattern: reusable solution to a problem that occur in a particular context
- Microservice pattern language: collection of interrelated software architecture and design patterns for microservices
- Monolithic architecture: archi style that structures a system (implementation *view*) as a single executable or deployable component
- Microservice architecture: archi style that structures a system (implementation *view*) as a set of multiple loosely coupled, independently deployable services
- Service: standalone, independently deployable software component that implements some useful functionality
