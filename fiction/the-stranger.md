# The Stranger

## Info
- Type: book
- Author: Albert Camus

## Impression
- The trial:
  - Lack of recognition of individual difference
  - Lack of recognition of factors from chance
- The main character is not as indifferent as I thought, he still feels and reacts to certain things
- The indifference is due to a reason, strongly illuminated at the end conversation:
existential crisis that death will happen to everyone, sooner or later
