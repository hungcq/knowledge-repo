- Key message is imp, but the story is stretch out too hard -> lack of substance
- Hard to focus on the main story, as the Shah parts are extremely irrelevant & distracting
- Key messages:
  - Economic redistribution and stability can't fill the lack of meaning created by low quality work
  - Warning about a society where everything is automated, technology is applied with the sole goal of economic growth, 
  without consideration for human welfare
