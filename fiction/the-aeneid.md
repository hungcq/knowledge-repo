# The Aeneid

## Impression
- Homeric style
- Duty and fate
- Stoicism
- Adventurers vs those want to stay
- Underworld, hell, heaven
- Wars start from passion (Juno's reply to Venus)
- Cost of war (Diomedes's talk)
- Heroism, defy death (Turnus's talk)
- Chaos, things not go as planned (how wars started)
- Reversal of fortune
