# Impression
- Women as prizes
- Personal gods
- Superstition
- Respect towards enemy
- Indiscriminate death: identity, talent, love from others, glory all meaningless. Vanity. Life > everything else.
- Humility: know your own strength & who is stronger
- Meaningless wars
- Keeping promise
- Lots of comparison with nature & wild animals
- Destiny
- Commitment to previous decisions
- Kind deeds of the death remembered
- Boring irrelevant digressions
