## Introduction
- Research techniques:
  - Experimental studies
  - Systematic immersion into the world of compliance professionals:
    - Interview
    - Examination of written materials
    - Posing as a compliance professional or aspiring one in dif orgs

## 1. Weapons of influence
- Fixed-action pattern (automatic behavior pattern):
  - Def: intricate sequences of behavior, acted in the same fashion and in the same order most of the time
  - Trigger feature: often will be just a tiny aspect of the totality
- Evolutionary role: work out most of the time in natural env. But can be tricked.
- Evo role of shortcuts in human beha: deal with huge amount of info
- -> More relevant in info age
- Human auto behavior is not only instinctive but also cultural
### Additional info
- When we ask someone to do us a favor, we will be more successful if we provide a reason. Not necessarily good reason.
- You get what you pay for -> expensive = good
- Contrast principle: ~ anchoring. Eg: present expensive item first as an anchor for comparison -> the other item is cheap

## 2. Reciprocation
- Imp evo role: facilitate coordination
- Cultural influence to enforce reciprocation
- Chars:
  - Override other factors like liking
  - Uninvited debts also work because of social obligation to receive
  - Can trigger unfair exchange: larger returned favor. Causes:
    - Internal social discomfort
    - External social pressure
- Reciprocal concession:
  - Def: obligation to make a concession to someone who has made a concession to us
  - Rejection then retreat technique:
    - Def: make larger request that are likely to be rejected, then make smaller, intended request
    - -> Bargaining: begin with extreme demands, but not too extreme as to be seen as unreasonable
    - Causes of effectiveness:
      - Reciprocation
      - Perceptual contrast
      - Logically: might have the first request satisfied
    - Advs:
      - Increase commitment rate: requestee feels greater responsibility for the arrangement
      - Increase chance for future favors: requestee feels greater satisfaction with the arrangement
- Handling tactics:
  - Refuse the request: psychological damage
  - Refuse the initial favor:
    - Difficult in practice
    - Miss the benefit of real free offer
    - -> Social friction & isolation
  - Redefine: if not an actual favor but sale device
  - -> No longer feel bad to refuse. Can even exploit back -> reciprocation.
### Additional info
- Free sample marketing technique: 2 purposes:
  - Provide info
  - Trigger reciprocation
- Allow man to buy a drink = sexually obligated in some cultures

## 3. Commitment and consistency
- Beha: desire to be & appear consistent with earlier choices
- -> Might act against best interest
- Cause: personal & social pressure
- Advs of consistency:
  - Evo, informational: reduced mental effort
  - Psychological: protection against troubling realization resulted from logic
- Trigger: commitment, promise
- Alter self-image by small commitment. Advs:
  - Non-specific: cover a whole range of related situations
  - Self-sustained belief
- -> Influence future beha
- Compliant techniques:
  - Foot-in-the-door: obtain a large purchase by starting with a small one
  - Induce to make a choice. After committed, remove the inducement
  - -> The commitment can self-sustained
  - -> Adv: make a person feel pleased with a poor choice
  - -> Suitable when there is only poor choice to offer
- Conditions for effective commitment:
  - Active action (eg written stms)
  - Public commitment
  - Extra effort (sunk cost fallacy)
  - Inner responsibility for the commitment (more imp)
  - -> Need to reduce external pressure (eg reward & threat)
- Handling tactic: pay attention to signals of foolish consistency:
  - Tighten stomach
  - Ask yourself: "would I make the same choice with current info", then trust the first feeling
  - -> No time to rationalize
### Addi
- Techniques:
  - Under-supply the promised gift
  - Ask to predict the donated amount
  - Ask how are you feeling
  - -> Feeling well -> hard to be stingy after
- Imp role of harsh initiation ceremony in increasing group's survival & solidarity

## 4. Social proof
- Beha: assume that an action is more correct if others are doing it
- Optimal conditions:
  - Uncertainty
  - Follow people similar to ourselves
- Handling tactics:
  - When social proof is deliberate faked: make a conscious decision to be alert to counterfeit social evidence
  - Recheck the facts
### Addi
- Sound of laughter: cue that sth is funny
- Sale technique: label the product as "fastest growing", "largest selling"
- Cause of bystander inaction: everyone is unsure but looks at others' inaction for cue -> no action
- -> How to seek help in such situation: isolate one indi from the crowd & call for help: provide specific instructions
- -> No uncertainty, clear responsibility, clear actions to perform
- Use a number of compliant group members as examples for social proof

## 5. Liking
- Beha: prefer to say yes to the requests of someone we know and like
- Compliant techniques:
  - Get then mention the name of a friend who recommend
  - When formed friendships are not present: try to be liked
- Factors that cause reliable liking:
  - Physical attractiveness (halo effect)
  - Similarity (eg clothes, background, interest, opinion, personal trait, lifestyle)
  - Compliments (eg I like you). Don't have to be true.
  - Frequent contact under good experience. Cooperation towards common goals.
  - -> Technique: establish that both are working for the same goals (eg work against the bad guy like their boss)
  - Association with good things. Techniques to associate with the things we like:
    - Good-looking models
    - Cultural symbols
    - Celebrities
    - Community project
    - Food
- Handling tactics:
  - Deal with specific liking factor: too many & work unconsciously
  - -> Hard to achieve
  - General tactic: focus on not the causes, but the effect:
  the feeling that we have come to like the practitioner more quickly or more deeply than we would have expected
  - -> Then:
    - Reverse action: dislike them
    - -> Might be unfair, forgo actually nice people
    - Separate the liked person from the request
### Addi
- Competitive activities increase hostility towards other groups
- -> Collaboration towards common goal reduces conflict
- People become fonder of the people and things they experienced while they are eating
- When prestige is low: more likely to:
  - Associate ourselves with successful others
  - Inflate the success of related people

## 6. Authority
- Beha: willingness of adults to go to almost any lengths on the command of an authority
- Causes:
  - Social benefits
  - For indi:
    - Informational: trusting expert
    - No risk of disobedience to higher power
- Compliant technique: recommendation from authority/experts
- The appearance of authority is enough. Cues used when lacking real authority substances:
  - Titles
  - Clothes (eg uniform, business suit)
  - Trappings (eg car, jewelry)
- Handling tactics:
  - Aware of power of authority & how easy it can be faked:
    - Need to distinguish real & not real expert: focus on field of expertise
    - Need to check whether the expert is honest: anything to gain from the recommendation?
    - -> Aware of counter move when they pretend to argue to a degree against their own interests
### Addi
- Association between size and status

## 7. Scarcity
- Beha: opportunities seem more valuable to us when their availability is limited
- Cause: loss aversion, regret aversion of forgone oppo
- Compliant techniques:
  - Limited number: inform the customer that a certain product is in short supply that cannot be guaranteed to last long
  - Deadline: place some official time limit on the customer's oppo to get the offer
  - -> No time to think
- Causes of effectiveness: psychological reactance: try to retain freedom of choice when it is limited/threatened
- -> Rationalize afterward about the positive qualities of the product
- Also apply to non-material things: info, messages, communications, knowledge
- Conditions for effectiveness:
  - Drop from abundance to scarcity > constance scarcity
  - Drop because of demand > normal drop
  - -> Competitiveness
- Handling tactics:
  - Difficulty: typical reaction to scarcity hinders the ability to think
  - Tactics:
    - Pay attention to competitive arousal -> cue
    - Distinguish between the joy of possessing vs experiencing: what we want from the item
### Addi
- Exclusive info is more persuasive
- Techniques:
  - Schedule the same appointment time for prospective buyers
  - Auction format: trigger competitiveness

## Epilogue
- Summary: increasingly complex world
- -> Revert to simple cue, auto response to guide decision
- -> More susceptible to trick of compliance professionals
- -> Need tactics to identify & retaliate

# Criticism
- Is there a misunderstanding between gene selection and social selection?
- Some real-life stories seem to be cherry-picked
- Chap 4 social proof handling tactic 2: how can we recheck the fact when we do things automatically?
