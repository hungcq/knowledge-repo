## Introduction
- Research techniques:
  - Experimental studies
  - Systematic immersion into the world of compliance professionals:
    - Interview
    - Examination of written materials
    - Posing as a compliance professional or aspiring one in dif orgs

## 1. Weapons of influence
- Fixed-action pattern (automatic behavior pattern):
  - Def: intricate sequences of behavior, acted in the same fashion and in the same order most of the time
  - Trigger feature: often will be just a tiny aspect of the totality
- Evolutionary role: work out most of the time in natural env. But can be tricked.
- Evo role of shortcuts in human beha: deal with huge amount of info
- -> More relevant in info age
- Human auto behavior is not only instinctive but also cultural
### Additional info
- When we ask someone to do us a favor, we will be more successful if we provide a reason. Not necessarily good reason.
- You get what you pay for -> expensive = good
- Contrast principle: ~ anchoring. Eg: present expensive item first as an anchor for comparison -> the other item is cheap

## 2. Reciprocation
- Imp evo role: facilitate coordination
- Cultural influence to enforce reciprocation
- Chars:
  - Override other factors like liking
  - Uninvited debts also work because of social obligation to receive
  - Can trigger unfair exchange: larger returned favor. Causes:
    - Internal social discomfort
    - External social pressure
- Reciprocal concession:
  - Def: obligation to make a concession to someone who has made a concession to us
  - Rejection then retreat technique:
    - Def: make larger request that are likely to be rejected, then make smaller, intended request
    - -> Bargaining: begin with extreme demands, but not too extreme as to be seen as unreasonable
    - Causes of effectiveness:
      - Reciprocation
      - Perceptual contrast
      - Logically: might have the first request satisfied
    - Advs:
      - Increase commitment rate: requestee feels greater responsibility for the arrangement
      - Increase chance for future favors: requestee feels greater satisfaction with the arrangement
- Tactics to deal with:
  - Refuse the request: psychological damage
  - Refuse the initial favor:
    - Difficult in practice
    - Miss the benefit of real free offer
    - -> Social friction & isolation
  - Redefine: if not an actual favor but sale device
  - -> No longer feel bad to refuse. Can even exploit back -> reciprocation.
### Additional info
- Free sample marketing technique: 2 purposes:
  - Provide info
  - Trigger reciprocation
- Allow man to buy a drink = sexually obligated in some cultures

# Criticism
- Is there a misunderstanding between gene selection and social selection?
- Some real-life stories seem to be cherry-picked
