# Introduction
- Things happen outside are hard to control
- -> Control the way we perceive, interpret outside events
- The root of discontent: people are too focused on what they want to achieve
that they cease to derive pleasure from the present
- Optimal experience: provide great happiness, pleasure
- The way religions present their truths no longer make people believe in a scientific era,
even though the substance of the truths may remain
- Social controls are based on threats or pleasures. Society exploits biological desires and survival instincts.
- Through control over consciousness, one can get rid of anxieties, fears and become free of the controls of society

# The anatomy of consciousness
- Consciousness is the result of biological processes, but can be self-directed
- Function of consciousness: represent information about inside and outside events in a way
that it can be evaluated and acted upon
- Intentions: the force that keeps information in consciousness in order
- There is a limit to the amount of information we can process at any given time
- In control of consciousness: able to focus attention at will, oblivious to distractions,
concentrate for as long as it take to achieve a goal
- The "self":
  - Contain everything passed through consciousness
  - The sum of consciousness contents and the structure of its goals
  - Self controls attention, attentions control consciousness contents & goals, contents & goals make up self
- Psychic disorder: information that conflicts with existing intentions
or distracts us from carrying them out (pain, fear, rage, anxiety, jealousy).
Psychic entropy: a disorganization of the self that impairs its effectiveness.
- Optimal experience: opposite state from the condition of psychic entropy.
When the information that keeps coming into awareness is appropriate with goals, psychic energy flows effortlessly.
- The self organization grow to be more complex by 2 psychological processes: differentiation & integration

# Enjoyment and the quality of life
- Improve quality of life: change external condition, change how we experience external condition
- Pleasure: feeling of contentment that one achieves whenever information in consciousness says that
expectations set by biological programs or by social conditioning have been met
- Enjoyment: characterized by forward movement: by a sense of novelty, of accomplishment
