- Some highlights:
  - Women's right movement
  - Increasing role of science
  - Feminist moment & impact on sex science

#### 2. Mind the gap - statistics around sex and desire
- Stats about frequency, satisfaction & sexual problems:
  - Only a small part feels distressed by the problem
- Positive impact of sex on relationship & exceptions
- Causes of sexual distress:
  - Negative impact on partner
  - How we are sexually, esp regarding desire, is lower than expectation, 
- Desire:
  - Difference in sexual desire between partners is common
  - -> Negotiating the difference is imp to have good sex
  - Factors affecting desire:
    - Less biology, more psychology
    - -> Not much difference between men & women
    - Typical drop in desire after entering companionate love phase (1-2 years):
      - Time is not the key factor -> can work on other factors
      - Drop in desire doesn't always lead to sexual/relationship dissatisfaction
    - Difference between genders:
      - Belief that men have higher desire is not supported by research
      - -> Such expectation has negative impact on men
      - Long-term monogamy & gender inequality reduce women's desire
  - Difficulty in measuring & deciding what is the right amount of desire:
    - Desire is not static -> can only measure in one moment
    - Desire depends on context
    - Women's desire is more responsive

- Sexual scripts
- Structure of female's genitals
- Biological/psychological mechanism of sex & desire, esp of women: pleasure, orgasm, spontaneous vs responsive desire
- -> How to cultivate good sex & relationship
- Opportunity for reflections on past experience
