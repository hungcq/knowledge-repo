### 1. Emotions across cultures
- Emotion def: a process, a particular kind of automatic appraisal influenced by our evolutionary and personal past,
in which we sense that something important to our welfare is occurring,
and a set of physiological changes and emotional behaviors begins to deal with the situation
- Universal emotions & facial expressions

### 2. When do we become emotional?
- Evolved themes & learned themes (variations).
- 9 ways to become emotional:
  - Automatic appraisal
  - Reflective appraisal
  - Remembering emotional scene
  - Imagining emotional scene
  - Talking about emotional scene
  - Empathy
  - Others' instructions
  - Violation of social norms
  - Voluntarily assuming the appearance of emotion

### 3. Changing what we become emotional about
- Refractory period.
- Learned trigger (1) -> cell assembly in brain (memory of learned trigger) (2) -> emotional response (3)
- 6 factors determining how successful the attempt to reduce power of trigger and length of refractory period (1):
  - Closeness to the evolved theme:
    - Closer -> harder
    - Physical actions > words
  - Closeness to the original situation
  - How early in life
  - Strength of the initial emotions
  - Density (how often) of the initial experiences
  - Affective style (speed, strength, duration): depends on individual: faster, stronger response -> harder
- Weaken the trigger:
  - Identify the trigger: aware of emotion -> keep a log of when
  - Avoid/anticipate the situation
  - Cool the trigger: thinking about the event afterward, consider alternative explanations
- Mood: easy to trigger related emotion
- Mood vs emotion. Mood:
  - Longer: days. Emotion: seconds, minutes.
  - Slight but continuous emotional state
  - Trigger related emotions
  - No signal in face or voice. Identified via emotions triggered.
  - Bias interpretation of and response
  - Can't identify the trigger:
    - Randomly
    - Dense emotional experiences

### 4. Behaving emotionally
- Problems:
  - Overact under emotions
  - No emotions
  - Feel emotions but no/lack of expressions
- Emotional behavior: signals, actions, internal changes
- Signals: instant, can't be turned off, universal, don't say anything about the source:
  - Facial expressions: easy to fake
  - Voice: very hard to hide/fake, capture attention
  - Physical action: easy to inhibit
- Learned actions:
  - Easier & faster to learn if consistent with preset actions
  - Operate automatically
- Internal changes:
  - Body: detectable
  - Thought:
    - Memories related to the emotion
    - Interpretation of situation is consistent with emotion -> justify and maintain emotion
  - Regulatory patterns: modify behavior
- Affect program:
  - Preset but can be added with learned behaviors
  - Can't be interrupted
- Emotions rarely occur singly or in pure form:
  - Sequential
  - Overlapping & blending
- Learned response maybe unlearn-able
- How easy to unlearn:
  - Bodily movement > voice & facial
  - How early in life when acquired: earlier -> harder
  - How intense and dense the emotional episodes
- Emotional consciousness: aware of the feeling vs consciousness:
  - Appraisal awareness
  - Impulse awareness
  - Reflective consciousness / attentiveness: able to observe ourselves during an emotional episode,
  ideally before more than a few seconds have passed. We recognize that we are being emotional
  and can consider whether or not our response is justified.
  We can reevaluate, reappraise, and if that is not successful, then direct what we say and do.
  This occurs while we are experiencing the emotion, as soon as we have become conscious of our emotional feelings and actions.
- Increase attentiveness: familiar with:
  - Triggers
  - Sensations & body feelings
  - Observe others
- Attentiveness may not work if:
  - Intense emotion
  - Importing a script which is not identified
  - In a relevant mood
