# Author's goals
- Non-goal: demonstrate how to be happy
- Describes what science has to tell us about how and how well the human brain can imagine its own future, 
and about how and how well it can predict which of those futures it will most enjoy
- -> The obvious answer to what will make us most happy is often wrong

# Style
- Author has a good sense of humor
- Lots of reference to academic text in Notes
- Author's claim: no single science has ever produced a compelling solution to the puzzle.
Weaving together facts and theories from psychology, cognitive neuroscience, philosophy, and behavioral economics,
this book allows an account to emerge that the author personally finds convincing.

# Content
## Intro
- People are future-focused, trying to make the future-self happy
- -> Foresight is limited, most of the time the plans don't work out
- The mistake of foresight is regular & systematic

## I - Prospection
### 1. Journey to elsewhen
- We think about the future in a way that no other animal can, does, or ever has,
and this simple, ubiquitous, ordinary act is a defining feature of our humanity
