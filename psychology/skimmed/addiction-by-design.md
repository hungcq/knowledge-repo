# Author's goals
- Explores the significance of the meteoric expansion of modern machine gambling over the past two decades in the US
through an examination of the relationship between the changing technological configuration of gambling activities
and the changing experience of gamblers
- Look at addiction from a new light: not only as a problem of the gambler (recent focus)
but the repeated interaction between the gambler and the object
- Explore the predicaments, tendencies, and challenges that characterize the culture and society through gambling tendency
- Explore the machine zone and the broader constellation of material, social,
and political-economic circumstances out of which it emerges and from which it seeks escape

# Style
- Paying close attention to elements of gambling machine design and the kinds of affective self-management they afford gamblers
- Tracking back and forth between gamblers' experience and the array of environments, objects,
and software programs with which they interact
- -> Avoids the tendency of strict materialism to treat technology as an autonomous, determining force, 
while also avoiding the tendency of human-centered approaches to regard technology as a passive, neutral tool
- Draws on research I conducted during several extended visits to Las Vegas between 1992 and 2007
- Focus: Las Vegas: leader in number of experiments & maturity of gambling machine
- Casting the addicted gambler not as aberrant or mal-adapted consumers, but as experts on the "zone" in which they are caught
