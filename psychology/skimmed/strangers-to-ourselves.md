# Structure
- Chap 1: looking outward at our own behavior, instead of introspection, as a different approach to self-understanding

# Author's goals
- Main questions:
  - Why it is that people often do not know themselves very well
  (e.g., their own characters, why they feel the way they do, or even the feelings themselves)?
  - -> Much of what we want to know about ourselves resides outside of conscious awareness.
  - How can they increase their self-knowledge (discover our non-conscious traits, goals, and feelings)?
- Is it always to our advantage to do so?
- To what extent are researchers in academe rediscovering Freud and psychoanalysis?
- How can self-knowledge be studied scientifically?

# Style
- Lots of reference to academic text
