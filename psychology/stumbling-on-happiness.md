- Corrigibility: ~improvement

# Style
- Claimed by authors: multi-discipline account -> readers need to judge for themselves
- Funny, accessible

- Lots of reference to academic text in Notes

# Criticism
- Some descriptions of experiments are difficult to understand
- Failure to ack the limitation of lab experiments

# Content
## Foreword
- People are future-focused, trying to make the future-self happy
- -> Foresight is limited, most of the time the plans don't work out
- The mistake of foresight is regular & systematic
## I - Prospection
### 1. Journey to elsewhen
- Human's unique ability to predict:
  - Nexting vs predicting:
    - Nexting: predict about local, immediate, personal future
    - Predicting (frontal lobe): project ourselves into the future, make long term plan
  - Why making predictions:
    - Emotion:
      - Good event: pleasurable
      - Bad event:
        - Reduce/avoid unpleasant impact
        - Enforce prudent behavior via fear, anxiety, worry
    - Control:
      - Having control: fundamental need, positive emotional impact
    - Wrong reason: to control the future -> book's goal
## II - Subjectivity
### 2. The view from in here
- Different conceptions of happiness: emotional, moral & judgemental:
  - Emotional: subjective feeling of happiness
  - Moral: mistaking cause of happiness (virtues) vs happiness feeling
  - Judgemental: use "happy that" as an expression of approval
- -> Emotional happiness matters more to individual
- Difficulty in comparing subjective happiness:
  - Remembering: memory reduce exp for efficiency -> difficulty in comparing present & past exp
  - Perception: comparing moment to moment exp is more reliable, but requires attention
  - Communication:
    - Language reduces exp for communication
    - Language-squishing hypothesis & experience-stretching hypothesis:
    feeling more/less happy due to limited/extensive exp

### 3. Outside looking in
- Scientific study of happiness (psychology in general):
  - Difficulty
  - Mitigation:
