- Describe a change that has started to happen.
  Related verbs: getting, becoming changing, improving, starting, beginning increasing, rising, falling, growing
- Talk about that is already decided and arranged to do in the future
- Talk about sth just before you start to do it. Usually used with words of movement (eg go/come/leave).
#### Other cases

- always doing something = do it too often or more often than normal (eg always looking at the phone)
- think: can use when its meaning is "consider" (eg thinking about getting a new job), not when its meaning is "have an opinion"
- look/feel: can use when talking about how sb looks or feels now
- be + being: describe how sb is behaving now, in contrast to normal behavior (eg you are being selfish)

### 2. Present simple (I do)
- Describe something happens all the time or repeatedly
- Describe something that is true in general
- Describe how often we do things
- Describe permanent situations
- Describe timetables/programmes/fixed schedules or plans
#### Other cases

- Use with (list 1): like want need prefer know realise understand recognise believe suppose remember mean belong fit
contain consist seem
- -> Can't use in continuous form (both present and past continuous)

### 5. Past simple
- Describe completed action
- Describe one thing happened after another
- Examples:
  - It was a good holiday

### 6.Past continuous
- was doing something = was in the middle of doing it at a certain time.
The action or situation started before this time, but had not finished. Examples:
  - This time last year I was living in Hong Kong.
  - What were you doing at 10 o'clock last night?
- Something happened (past simple) in the middle of something else (past continuous)

### 7-8, 11. Present perfect
- Provide new info (can also use past simple). If continue to talk about it, then normally use the past simple.
- Describe an action in the past that has a result now (can also use past simple)
- Talk about a period of time that continues from the past until now
(eg have ever done sth in life, recently, in the last few days, so far, since I arrived)
Use with today, this evening, this year... when these periods are not finished at the time of speaking.
- Talk about new/recent happening (can also use past simple)
- Use with: this is the n-th times
- Comparison with past simple:
  - Past simple only tells us about the past. We don't know what the current situation is (eg lost a key, but might have found it).
  - Present perfect tells about the present
#### Other case
- has been to somewhere = visited, not there now
- has gone to somewhere = is there now or is on the way there

### 9. Present perfect continuous
- Describe an activity that has recently stopped or just stopped. Eg:
  - Why are you so tired? What have you been doing?
  - How long have you been waiting?
- Use with how long/for/since for activity that is still happening or has just stopped
- Describe repeating actions. Eg: I have been doing it for years
- Comparison with present perfect:
  - Present perfect continuous:
    - We are thinking of the activity. It does not matter whether it has been finished or not.
    - Describe how long (for something that is still happening)
  - Present perfect:
    - Sth has been finished. We are thinking about the result of the activity (the painted bedroom), not the activity itself.
    - Describe how much, how many or how many times (for completed actions)
    - Use for verbs that can't be in -ing form (except want and mean that can be used with present perfect continuous)
    - Use with "always"

### 15. Past perfect (I had done)

  (eg when I arrived, she had already left).
  - Talk about sth that happened up to some point in the past (~present perfect - up to the present)
  
### 16. Past perfect continuous (I had been doing)
