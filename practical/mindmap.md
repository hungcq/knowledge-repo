## Content
- Should do Prestudy & priming: get the big picture, skeleton of main topics
- Chars of good mindmap:
  - Grouped: into categories (boxes). Try to group in dif ways.
  - Reflective: reflect what the thought process, what is in the mind, not what is in the material
  - -> Think first: clean up & organize the info:
  make it simple, relevant, logical, intuitive (eg via associations with known concepts)
  - Interconnected: connect the boxes. Look for new/distinct connections.
  - Non-verbal: more creative method of expression instead of words (eg abbr, dual arrows)
  - Directional: combination, arrow to reflect cause & effect relationship
  - -> Make more sense
  - Emphasized: make the main points more distinctive -> must identify those
  - -> Make the technique lightweight (easier to trace relevant parts) to focus on the learning itself
