- Chars of good mindmap:
  - Grouped: into categories (boxes)
  - Reflective: reflect what is in your mind into the note
  - Interconnected: connect the boxes. Look for new/distinct connections.
  - Non-verbal: more creative method of expression instead of words (eg abbr, dual arrows)
  - Directional: combination, arrow to reflect cause & effect relationship
  - -> Make more sense
  - Emphasized: make the main points more distinctive -> must identify those
  - -> Make the technique lightweight (easier to trace relevant parts) to focus on the learning itself
- Tips:
  - Should reflect what is in the mind, not what is in the material
  - Think first: clean up & organize the info: make it simple, logical, intuitive (eg via associations with known concepts)
