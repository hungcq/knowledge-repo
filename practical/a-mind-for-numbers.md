# 1. Diffuse Mode
- Skim -> prime, organize thoughts
- Focused (highly attentive state) vs diffuse thinking (big picture, resting state network)
- Einstellung effect: stuck on the wrong approach: jump on the problem before understand the fundamentals

# 2. Switch modes
- Activities: bus, bath, bed, walk, sport, music...
- Take note about the problem before & after going to bed
- Sleep:
  - Make neural connections
  - Meaning, big picture, creativity
  - Strengthen important parts, remove trivialities
- Frustration as a rest signal
- Talk to people when stuck

# 3. Chunking
- Chunk: pieces of info bound together by meaning
- -> Get the main idea, save working memory
- 3 steps to form chunk:
  - Focus attention
  - Understand the idea
  - Practice: gain context, when to use the chunk
- Bottom up chunking process (how) vs Top down big picture process (when)
- Interleaving > overloading: practice by doing dif problems requiring dif strats

# 4. Recall
- Increase understanding
- Should be within a day
- Recall outside usual context
- Illusion of competence: reread -> fluency < recall

# 5. Build a chunked library
- Step by step nature of math/science problem
- Deliberate practice
- Build a chunked lib: build intuition in problem-solving:
  - Work the problem on paper
  - Repeat, attend to key process
  - Break
  - Sleep
  - Repeat, focus on hard part (deliberate practice)
  - Active repetition while doing sth easy
- -> Move on to a new problem

# 6. Procrastination
- No time for both modes
- Bad habit, addiction
- Procrastinate about uncomfortable things, seek temp pleasure
- Excuse for doing poorly & pride for being smart

# 7. Habit of Procrastination
- 4 parts of habit:
  - Cue: remove
  - Routine: create new
  - Reward: create new
  - Belief: community, mental contrasting (now vs expectation)
- Focus on process, not product (expected outcome): break into small tasks
- Pomodoro 25-min session:
  - Ignore distraction
  - Practice being under stress

# 8. Procrastination tools & tips
- Daily task list: create in the evening
- Weekly task list: big picture
- Do the most disliked job in the morning
- Quit time
- Meditation: ignore distracting thoughts
- Backup plan for procrastination periods 

# 9. Memory
- Visuo-spatial memory
- Memory palace
- Importance of concentration
- Space repetition: a day in between -> enhance long term mem
- Write by hand & speak aloud
- Cards
- Groups & abbreviations
- Story
- Closely connected to creativity
- Physical exercises
- Big working mem -> less creative

# 10. Mindâ€™s eye
- Equation: abstraction, simplification of concept
- -> Deeper meaning
- Personalize & visualize concepts/ideas
- Learn abstract concept without application
- -> Easier to transfer to other disciplines

# 11. Mentor
- Pick question carefully. Avoid show off questions.
- Avoid describe your wrong approach. Listen to suggestion first.

# 12. Avoiding Overconfidence
- Left hemisphere: logical, focused vs Right: critical, big picture
- Recheck solution: not much time needed
- Hard to spot your own error
- Value of brainstorming with others & straight criticism

# 13. Test taking
- Testing effect: test & recall: important learning exp
- Test prep check list
- Start with hard problem first. Switch to easy problem when stuck for 1-2 min. Not consider when:
  - Hard: low point
  - Not prepared
- Deal with stress:
  - Reframe interpretation of stress symptoms -> excitement
  - Deep stomach breath

# 14. Other info & tips
- Take course slowly -> learn deeply
- Blinking/deliberate eye close -> change view, big picture
- Breath slowly to nap
- Focus attention to connect parts of brain
- Focus practice & repetition to create memory traces
- Breadth knowledge -> connection & novelty
- Practice & repetition: strengthen neural pattern
- Knowledge collapse: natural
- Organize materials
- Choking: not enough working memory
- Stress level & motivation
- Pause and reflect: categorize problem first
- Analogy -> neural pattern
- Independent study -> deeper
