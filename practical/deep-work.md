### Work Deeply (how to integrate deep work into schedule & support it with routines and rituals):
- 4 deep work philosophies: monastic, bimodal, rhythmic, journalistic
- Systematize work habit: where & how long, how (rule, method), supports needed
- Make an investment to commit to deep work
- Build a strict shutdown ritual

### Embrace Boredom (methods to improve limit of concentration ability):
- Schedule distracting blocks of time
- Schedule hard deadline several times a week
- Find solution for a problem while physically active
- Practice memorizing a deck of card

### Quit Social Media (apply thoughtful philosophy to adopting tools):
- Any-benefit mindset & tool-selection rule: adopt a tool only if its positive impacts on core factors substantially outweigh its negative impacts
- Law of the vital few: 80% of a given effect is due to just 20% of possible causes => focus on the 20% important activities
- Apply 30-day period to test necessity of a social media site
- Spend 16 hours outside of work in meaningful activities

### Drain the Shallows (identify & cut down shallowness in current schedule):
- Schedule every minute of your day
- Quantify the depth of every activity: how long it would take (in months) to train a smart recent college graduate with no specialized training in my field to complete this task
- Ask your boss for a shallow work budge and stick to that plan
- Fix-schedule productivity: finish your work by 5:30; try to say "no" to shallow tasks, don't give details to the reason why "no".
- Become hard to reach (email habit)
