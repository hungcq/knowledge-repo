## Take10 Summary

### 1. Getting ready
- 5-10 min to chill if necessary.
- Find a place to sit down comfortably, keeping a straight back.
- Ensure you’ll be left undisturbed during your meditation (switch off your cell phone).
- Set the timer for ten minutes.

### 2. Checking-in: 5 min
- Take 5 deep breaths, breathing in through the nose and out through the mouth and then gently close your eyes.
- Focus on the physical sensation of the body on the chair and the feet on the floor. Also sound, smell…
- Scan down through the body and notice which parts feel comfortable and relaxed, and which parts feel uncomfortable and tense. 2 times.
- Notice how you’re feeling—i.e. what sort of mood you’re in right now.
- Recognize important events/issues of the day. 10 sec.

### 3. Focusing the mind
- Notice where you feel the rising and falling sensation of the breath most strongly. 30 sec.
- Notice how each breath feels, the rhythm of it—whether it’s long or short, deep or shallow, rough or smooth. 30 sec.
- Gently count the breaths as you focus on the rising and falling sensation—1 with the rise and 2 with the fall, upward to a count of 10.
- Repeat this cycle between 5 and 10 times, or for as long as you have time available.

### 4. Finishing-off
- Let go of any focus at all, allowing the mind to be as busy or as still as it wants to be for about twenty seconds.
- Bring the mind back to the sensation of the body on the chair and the feet on the floor. Also sound, smell…
- Gently open your eyes and stand up when you feel ready.
- Be clear about where to go & what to do next.
