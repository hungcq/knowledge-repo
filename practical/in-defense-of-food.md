# Presentation & style
- Author's claims:
  - Use nutrition science findings mainly for explanation & understanding
- Clear arguments, backed by scientific/statistical evidences

# Terms
- Nutritionism: food & human bodies should only be understood and engaged with in terms of their nutritional & chemical constituents & requirements

# Arguments
## I - The age of nutritionism
### 1. From foods to nutrients
- History of the rise of nutritionism: how nutrients replaced food
- Why gov/scientific recommendations changed from food to nutrients:
  - Pressure from industries
  - Scientific reductionism bias
- -> New way of thinking about food & health

### 2. Nutritionism defined
- Basic assumptions of nutritionism:
  - Foods are the sum of their nutrient parts
  - -> Need scientists to explain & guide us
  - Goal of eating is to maintain & promote bodily health
  - -> Nutrients in food should be divided into healthy & unhealthy ones
- -> Not science but ideology
- Problems:
  - Promote food fads & phobias
  - Focus on measured nutrients, not qualitative differences among foods
  - -> No dif between foods & processed foods

### 3. Nutritionism comes to market
- Review of imitation law & how it got repealed

### 4. Food science's golden age
- The rise of processed food & food science
- Health claim: easy to acquire, no scientific basis
- Attitude toward whole food in the age of nutritionism:
  - Labeled good or bad depending on popular nutritional orthodoxy
  - No health claims -> subsided

### 5. The melting of the lipid hypothesis
- The lipid hypothesis:
  - Def: dietary fat is responsible for chronic disease
  - Conclusions of recent review: low-fat campaign has been based on little scientific evidence & caused unintended health consequences:
    - Dietary fat & cholesterol has weak/no association with coronary heart disease
    - Strong association between trans fats (encouraged by the campaign) & coronary heart disease
    - No convincing evidence supports that low-fat diet causes weight loss
  - -> No one publicly ack

### 6. Eat right, get fatter
- How the dietary advice was taken: eat more other things
- Parties benefiting from the dietary recommendation:
  - Food industries
  - Nutrition scientists
  - Journalists

### 7. Beyond the pleasure principle
- Psychological consequences of nutritionism:
  - Confusion & anxiety
  - Reduced pleasure in eating
  - Blame illness on life-style choices -> individuals are responsible
- Review of historical ideas that undervalue pleasure in eating
- -> Basis for nutritionism

### 8. The proof in the low-fat pudding
- Evidences against the low-fat campaign - consequences on public health:
  - Increased obesity & diabetes
  - No reduction in heart disease

### 9. Bad science
- Flaws & difficulties of nutrition science:
  - Problematic assumption: food = sum of nutrient parts
  - -> Flawed approach: study one nutrient at a time (basic tool of science: study one variable at a time):
    - Not suitable for human: genetic differences
    - Take nutrient out of context of food: complex interaction between various chemical components -> can't isolate one nutrient
    - Take food out of context of diet:
      - Foods are eaten in combination & order
      - -> Affect how they are metabolized
      - When people eat a lot of one type of food, they eat less of sth else:
      - -> Bad effects might not be the result of one food, but the lack of sth else
    - Take diet out of context of lifestyle: when studying dif population, effect might be result of lifestyle, not diet
      (eg People taking supplements are more health-conscious. Supplements usually have no effect.)
  - Scientific tools too simple to understand complex systems as food & diet:
    - In experiments: when reduce sth, sth else is eaten instead
    - -> Always a second variable
    - Can't correct for placebo effect: no fake foods that taste like real foods
    - Focus on known nutrients -> subjected to continuous changes
    - Consult food nutrient value based on a standard table
    - -> Not account for qualitative differences
    - Flaws of 3 main methods of studying impact of diet:
      - Case-control study:
        - Method: ask how sick people eat -> determine causes in the diet
        - Problems:
          - Sick people might change the way they eat
          - Cause-seeking: people tend to report the current evil nutrient
      - Cohort study:
        - Method: collect data on eating habits & health outcomes of dif cohort groups over the long term
        - Problems:
          - Sample groups are quite uniform: all eat the same Western diet
          - -> Differences is not significant
          - -> Effect might not be detectable
          - Problems of food-frequency questionnaires:
            - People lie about their diet
            - Difficult questions & unreliable human memory -> can't recall
          - -> Unreliable data, easy to misinterprete/overinterprete
          - -> Can only be used to rank people on consumption of dif types of food
      - Intervention study:
        - Method:
          - Use a control group & a group that changes its diet following a prescription
          - Track both groups over the long run
          - -> Whether the intervention affects rates of chronic disease
        - Problems:
          - Same as cohort study
          - Changes in diet of control group (following recommendation) & other group (failed to follow prescription)

### 10. Nutritionism's children
- Summary of part I

## II - The Western diet and the diseases of civilization
### 1. The Aborigine in all of us
- The Aborigine study: revert to hunter-gatherer living & diet
- -> Conclusion: some of the most harmful effects of the Western diet could be quickly reversed

### 2. The elephant in the room
- Review of studies about effect of diet and health:
  - People who eat the Western diet (vs any traditional diet) suffer higher rates of cancer, cardiovascular diseases, diabetes
  - Western Price studies:
    - Populations thrived on dif kinds of diet
    - Traditional diet consisting of fresh foods from animals and plants grown on soils rich in nutrients leads to good health
  - Answers to objection that those chronic diseases are not the result of the Western diet:
    - Genetic: different races susceptible to dif diseases
    - -> Immigrants quickly acquire the disease when adopting the Western diet
    - Demographic: people in the West live longer -> acquire late chronic disease
    - -> Studies adjusted for age still find chronic disease rate higher
- Short discussion about ecological aspect of food & health
- Why interest in those studies waned: reliance on industrial food in wartime

### 3. The industrialization of eating: what we do know
- Foods from ecological point of view: relationships among species in food chains
- -> Health is the product of being in relationships in food chain
- -> Health of each part of the chain links to health of other part
- The Western diet: abrupt set of evolutionary changes to food & relationships, from the soil to the meal
- 5 fundamental changes:
  - Whole foods -> refined, esp carbohydrates:
    - Purposes:
      - Aesthetic
      - Extend shelf life -> store & transport
      - Ingest quicker -> biologically attractive
    - Consequences:
      - Less nutritious
      - -> Deficiency diseases
      - Obesity:
        - Higher energy density -> feeling less full
        - Ingest & metabolize quicker -> become hungry sooner
      - Diabetes: sugar level spike -> overwhelm ability of insulin to process
  - Complexity -> simplicity: levels of simplification:
    - Soil: industrial fertilizer simplify soil biochemistry
    - -> Declined nutritional value of plants
    - Species diversity: focus on small number of high-yield species, suitable for mechanical harvesting & processing
    - -> Simplified diet -> lack of nutrients
    - Food: process (deplete many nutrients) then add back only the known nutrient
  - Quality -> quantity:
    - Plants & animals breed for yield at the cost of nutritional quality
    - -> Cause: gov policy
    - Consequence: overfed & undernourished eaters
  - Leaves -> seeds:
    - Most imp change: leads to other changes
    - Why we rely on grains:
      - Grains are efficient at manufacturing macronutrients
      - -> Converted to meat, dairy & processed foods
      - Can be stored & used as commodity
      - -> Suitable for industrial capitalism
    - Consequences:
      - Miss our critical nutrients
      - Reduced omega-3 (more in leaves) / omega-6 (more in seeds) ratio
      - -> Various health problems
  - Food culture -> food science: what, how, why, when, how much we should eat
- -> Can be reversed without going back to hunter-gatherer living
- Solutions to the Western diet:
  - Rely on food science: the field not developed enough yet
  - Adapt biologically: no ideal condition for natural selection
  - Health care: economic cost, decreased quality of life

## III - Getting over nutritionism
### 1. Escape from the Western diet
- Nutrition science is imperfect, tries to explain problems of the Western diet
- -> Don't need to understand the mechanism to arrive at the solution: stop eating the Western diet
- Difficulty in execution
- -> Why we need the rules
- Scope: not provide specific menu, but general rules to shop for food or decide on a meal
- -> Goal:
  - Produce different menu, all healthy in the broad sense: soil, plants & animals, eaters (body & mind), food culture
  - Make the eating/shopping process simpler & more pleasurable than eating by the numbers & nutrients
- To eat well, need to invest more time & effort
- -> Some rules involve more work
- Scope & goal of each set of rules:
  - Eat food:
    - Related to shopping, in the form of filters
    - Goal: separate & defend real food from numerous food-like products, esp in the supermarket
  - Mostly plant: best types of foods to eat
  - Not too much:
    - How to eat food: manners, customs & habits governing relationship to food & eating
    - Goal: create healthy & pleasing culture of eating

### 2. Eat food: food defined
- Don't eat anything your great-grandmother wouldn't recognize as food:
  - Sub-rule: don't eat anything incapable of rotting
- Avoid food products containing ingredients that are:
  - Unfamiliar
  - Unpronounceable
  - More than 5 in number
  - Include high-fructose corn syrup
- Avoid food products that make health claims
- Shop the peripheries of the supermarket and stay out of the middle
- Get out of the supermarket whenever possible:
  - Supermarket, convenience store, fast-food outlet -> farmers' market
  - Why farmers' market:
    - Food in season -> most nutritious
    - Safe:
      - Competition -> diversification -> no pesticides
      - Personal contact -> responsibility > regulation
  - Sub-rule: shake the hand that feeds you

### 3. Mostly plants: what to eat
- Eat mostly plants, especially leaves:
  - Universal scientific consensus supporting diet rich in vegetables & fruits
  - Meat is nutritious, but should be used as condiment for the vegetables, not eaten in huge quantities, esp industrial meat
- You are what what you eat eats too: diet of the animals affect nutritional quality and healthfulness of the food from them
- -> Animals eating diet of grass produce better food
- If you have the space, buy a freezer. Why:
  - Cheaper
  - Buy & store food in season -> nutritious
  - Freezing doesn't reduce quality much
- Eat like an omnivore. Why:
  - New species: dif types of nutrient
  - Encourage biodiversity in the field -> healthier soil, plants & animals, less chemical pesticide/fertilizer
- Eat well-grown food from healthy soils: food both organic & local
- Eat wild foods when you can
- -> More nutritious
- Be the kind of person who takes supplements:
  - Why: more health conscious, better educated, more affluent:
  - Can consider taking multi-vitamin supplement, esp during old age
- Eat according to the rules of traditional food culture. Why: accumulated wisdom.
- Regard nontraditional foods with skepticism
- Don't look for the magic bullet in the traditional diet. Why: dietary patterns might be more than the sum of the contributing foods
- Have a glass of wine with dinner

### 4. Not too much: how to eat
- Pay more, eat less:
  - Why:
    - High quality food costs more
    - Health benefits from eating less
  - How:
    - Modest portions, no seconds
    - Eat until feeling full:
      - Pay attention to internal cues
      - Eat slowly for the full signal to have time to reach the brain
- Eat meals:
  - Why: socializing & educating opportunities
  - How:
    - Do all eating at a table
    - Don't get food from gas station
    - Try not to eat alone
- Eat slowly:
  - Literal sense: to know when to stop
  - Deliberate & knowledgeable
  - -> Appreciation, pleasure, humble to nature
- -> Might need to reform way of life
- Cook and, if can, plant a garden. Why:
  - Gardening:
    - Fresh food
    - Physical labor has a goal (unlike normal exercise)
    - Challenging -> satisfaction
    - Feel humber & appreciate the work of the farmers
  - Cooking:
    - Getting in touch with senses & culture
    - Feeling in control
    - Philosophical: chance to contemplate about food
- -> Subversive act: against nutritionism & industrial eating

# Criticism
- Some minor details are not correct/detailed enough:
  - Discussion about roles of antioxidants
  - Effect of alcohol
- Some rules in How to eat chapter are repeated, not well-organized

# Take away
- Understand nutritionism: definition, history & its effect on current food environment
- -> New way of looking at food & making food/eating choice
- Aware of the flaws of nutrition science
- -> Looking at food, health claims, effect of nutrient & food in a dif way
- Understand the Western diet: its set of changes & effect on health
- The sets of rules are practical & inducing attempts to buy, cook & eat in a healthy & pleasing way
