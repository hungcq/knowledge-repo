# Knowledge Repository

I'm a lifelong learner. Learning is my commitment-it gives my life meaning and purpose.
Everything else is a means to that end, tools that support and enable my learning.

By most standards, I'm a strong learner (I believe). Recently, without any formal background in finance or economics,
I completed the [CFA (Chartered Financial Analyst) Level 1](https://basno.com/dotg1acm) in just 3 months, scoring in the top 10%. 
[The curriculum](https://www.cfainstitute.org/programs/cfa-program/candidate-resources/level-i-exam#core-curriculum-topics)
is broad and demanding, often compared to a graduate-level program.
I also earned the [AWS Solutions Architect Associate certification](https://www.credly.com/badges/e02b602d-f604-4689-94d0-8b94d4f026c6)
within 1 month of studying, despite having no prior production experience with AWS.
I don't believe there's any subject I can't learn-given enough time and effort.

To support my learning, I've been maintaining this personal knowledge repository since 2021.
It's where I distill and document what I've learned, primarily from books, but also from other types of material.
The topics are broad, spanning philosophy, science, software engineering, and business.

Being effective matters-because time is limited. That's why I not only focus on what I learn, but also how I learn.
I'm constantly experimenting with new methods to improve comprehension, retention, and application:
new ways to practice, conceptualize, and structure information.
Most importantly, I study epistemology-the theory of knowledge-to refine my critical thinking
and sharpen my ability to distinguish real knowledge from pseudo one. This helps me focus my efforts on what truly matters.
